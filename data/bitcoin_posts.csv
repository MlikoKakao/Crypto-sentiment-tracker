## july payment statistics

we added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. monero

we have to start with **monero**.

it's eating up everything else in our pie chart. xmr now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

genuine props to the monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. nano

second biggest is once again **nano**. our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

it's also being integrated into btcpayserver right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the lightning network.

average btc transaction size was $24.48, while lightning's was $4.42. as expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. litecoin

digital silver **litecoin** plus the recently added litecoin mweb added up to 6.7%.

6.59% litecoin, 0.11% specifically mweb.

to be fair - we only added mweb payments about 7 days ago! read the blog for more on our mweb integration.

# honorable mention: zcash

finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **zcash** with 3.44%.

all the more remarkable given that zec payments were only added 2 weeks ago, and the much-requested shielded pay-in addresses a few days ago. 

# the full data

here's the complete breakdown for all coins:

* xmr: 52.91%
* xno: 17.71%
* btc: 10.20%
* ltc: 6.59%
* eth: 3.57%
* zec: 3.44%

* dash: 0.24%
* ban: 0.12%
* ltc-mweb: 0.11%
* kas: 0.05%
* egld: 0.01%
* pol: 0.01%

# kaspa, multiversx, dash, bitcoin cash

unfortunately as you can see kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

we know there are a lot of kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some kaspa people to hear how we can let kaspians know we exist!

another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was multiversx, with just 0.01% of total usage.

we know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in multiversx can get us on a podcast to explain nanogpt, we're all ears!

in a similar vein the typical payment coins like bitcoin cash and dash do not see the amount of usage on nanogpt that you would expect. we clearly need to up our outreach there!

# ""tachyon: scaling zcash with oblivious synchronization

zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. they provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. in short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

to enable this, zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. these proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. but the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-snarks](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“zk”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **we can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** we've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**now it’s time to cross the finish line.** i am proposing several protocol changes in zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. the crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that i refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. this new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** in the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. in order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “sapling” upgrade from earlier in zcash's history. back then, we set out to make zk-snarks practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. the sophistication of the sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)proof-carrying data

early in the history of zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-snarks. as mentioned, the [sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. however, zk-snarks are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. this has led to a misconception that zk-snarks are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in zcash.

in reality, we've never actually considered zk-snark verification a barrier to scaling zcash. i once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being snarkpack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

the ultimate tool for scaling zk-snark verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (pcd)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/ct10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind zcash. crudely speaking, pcd allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. this can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

pcd languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. this changed when our team at the electric coin company discovered [halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving pcd with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. as mentioned before, this led to a cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made pcd table stakes for new scalable protocols. pcd can be leveraged to make zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) as we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)communicating state changes

zk-snarks and pcd are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. however, privacy-preserving protocols like zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

there are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* how do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* how do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* how are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-snarks (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. by being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-snarks and pcd.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)shielded notes and commitments

shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [utxos](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in bitcoin. we aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-snark to prove that various rules are being followed. in order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

the commitment hides the note, but the zk-snark can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. this allows the zk-snark proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). in order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. the standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. the user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. the user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. other people use this address to make a payment.
4. the user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

this is how bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. the user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. in private cryptocurrencies like zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. in order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. this simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **as a start, we'll be assuming that zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** the on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over signal chats. in these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. it is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [uri-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

there are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. by moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) in order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. this at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)accumulators and nullifiers

in order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accumulator_(cryptography)). currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. we call this checkpoint an “anchor.” in order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

in order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. this works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-snark proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

if we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **the zk-snark helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** the nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**the scalability bottlenecks that remain in zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

it'll be helpful to recast what a zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

the wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. in each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. in all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. as long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-snark proof and spend the funds. (the wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) this is more or less how our wallets currently work.

my vision for scaling zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-snark proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** this means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. this effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

the result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) as a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

it would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain pcd of the wallet state. this expense is not just due to the cost of creating pcd proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

however, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the pcd proofs) to a third party that i call an **oblivious syncing service**. this service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

we already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomorphic_encryption) (fhe). **but by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use pcd.** the remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. one would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

in practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. but this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. fortunately, as i'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

this new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. the main changes involved include:

* **wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ecc has already begun exploring the incoporation of uri-encapsulated payments into its zashi mobile wallet. different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the zcash protocol. it also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** this involves implementing and deploying a pcd-based proof aggregation protocol for orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. this can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** this can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in pcd.** i've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. this will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **in-band secret distribution must be removed in zcash.** this can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **the payment protocol should allow wallet pcd state to augment the zk-snark in transactions.** this final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. this can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**i call this the tachyon project for zcash.** i'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. my goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. as with all of our previous network upgrades i'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

crucially, i don't plan to stand in the way of any other zcash protocol improvements while i see tachyon to fruition. i'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and i'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. i also have no reason to believe that tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as crosslink and zsas; in fact, i have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for tachyon.

there are many things i'll be sharing over the coming weeks. i'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that i've developed to be compatible with the orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. this should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

we live in a world where 🍆💩🧠👻 are one tap away, but **₿** , a globally recognized digital asset with a $1t+ market cap  is nowhere to be found even though bitcoin has :

\-been around since 2009

\-been declared legal tender in countries like el salvador

\-been integrated into major financial platforms

\-been traded globally for trillions of dollars

...the most common digital tools  ios, android, windows, macos still refuse to acknowledge it with a simple key or emoji meanwhile, obscure currencies, outdated symbols, and novelty emojis get full support. why?

**control over symbols is control over perception**

if something doesn’t have a symbol, it becomes harder to talk about, type, share, or normalize.  
it becomes invisible to the masses  not by force, but by friction. ask yourself:

\-why hasn't unicode approved a bitcoin emoji?

\-why don’t apple, google, microsoft or samsung include **₿** by default?

\-why do you need to copy/paste ₿ or create your own shortcut just to use it?

we're not talking about a joke coin here. we’re talking about an asset that has outperformed every major currency, equity, and commodity over the past decade.

**is this just neglect... or intentional?**

whether it's an oversight or something more deliberate, the message is clear: the system tolerates bitcoin. but it won’t *legitimize* it. and legitimacy  in a world of symbols, memes, and interfaces  begins with a single keystroke.

until then, keep copying and pasting: **₿**

in tradfi, last week stock markets had a good start of the week. then came wednesday, and the us fed announced that there would be no july rate cut. this was no surprise at all, and the markets didn’t react much. what they did react to was the following press conference, where chairman powell refused to give any promises of a september cut. this should have come as no surprise either, as powell has repeated over and over and again and again that they will always follow the data. but still, the markets were apparently somewhat disappointed, and sold off a little.

however, the bigger sell off came on thursday and friday, as trump announced a new barrage of tariffs that got everybody spooked, and as job number revisions came in much larger than expected. if we take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, so far this pull back is not large, and it could well turn into a normal correction in a strong uptrend.

turning to bitcoin, despite following the rest of the market down, it closed the week at $114k, still sitting well above the breakout point at $109k. the breakout has not been invalidated, and the conservative price target remains at $142k. so with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.

let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s news about tariffs and jobs. but for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.

i have a break through in nlp coming in as soon as two weeks if i wish.  you can see the existing version of the nlu engine at: https://cicero.sh/sophia/

new pos tagger is already done, although not published.  47k custom, hybrid and fine tuned logistic regression models, one per ambiguous word, work a charm.  far better than the existing pytorch based pos taggers out there.

from my calculations, next version of nlu engine should bring in about $3000/day in api calls, plus about $200k/month in enterprise sales.  this is supposedly the era of ai agents, except they simply don't work.  my nlu engine is deterministic, hence you can rely on it, and it will actually just work unlike the existing crap that's out there.

2025-08-03 05:07:58+00:00,"so, there is a post describing how a solo miner just scored a full bitcoin block reward. here is a breakdown on what actually happened and how insane it is a random solo miner just walked away with **3.125 btc (\~$373,000)** for mining **block 907,283** completely on their own, through the **solo ck pool**. that’s a win most miners can only dream of, while also being extremely rare.

this happened in **late july 2025**, and people are still trying to wrap their heads around just how improbable this really is. here's a full breakdown of how this went down, what the odds are and why it’s *technically possible* but *practically a miracle*.

# what actually happened?

* the miner was using **solo ck pool**, which lets people ""solo mine"" (that is, you submit valid shares as if you're trying to win the block reward all by yourself);
* unlike regular mining pools where rewards are split among contributors, in solo ck, **you either get the whole block or nothing**;
* in this case, the miner won **3.125 btc** (current block reward) + \~**$3.4k in transaction fees**, totaling **over $376,000** at current prices;
* the bitcoin **network difficulty** was at an all-time high: **\~126 trillion**. that means solving a block is harder than ever.

how rare is this exactly?

reddit lit up with calculators and probability charts. here’s what it boils down to:

# scenario 1 – hobbyist miner (~1 th/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260,000,000;**
* there are 144 blocks per day → daily chance ≈ 1 in 1.8 million;
* annual odds? **\~0.02% chance**, or **1 in \~5,000 per year;**

if you’re running a **bitaxe**, **futurebit apollo**, or something similar, you're statistically looking at **one success every 15,000–19,000 years**.

# scenario 2 – semi-pro (1 ph/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260;**
* annual success rate: \~**20%**, or **1 block per 5 years on average;**
* but 1 ph/s requires serious infrastructure, electricity, and cooling (100+ asics);

# scenario 3 – full-scale mining farm (100+ ph/s)

* now you’re mining a block every day or two;
* but also burning **thousands of dollars daily** in electricity and hardware depreciation.

**my point is unless you’re running an operation worth hundreds of thousands (if not millions), solo mining is more like buying a lottery ticket every 10 minutes.**

**the economic reality guys is that solo mining is almost never profitable!!!**

let’s say you’re running a 1 th/s device that consumes 100w. over a year:

* **electricity cost**: 100w × 24h × 365d = \~876 kwh at $0.15/kwh → $131.40/year

so even if the rig is cheap (\~$500), you’re paying yearly just to keep it running and you’ll *almost certainly never hit a block*. you’re losing money every year unless lightning strikes.

that said, what if you do hit?  
you're getting **3000x return overnight**. like another fellow redditor on this sub said: ""it’s the ultimate degen lottery.""

now, given all of the things talked above, why are some people still solo mining?

* some do it to support bitcoin's decentralization (proving individuals can still mine).
* others want to experiment, learn, or just take a long-shot bet.
* some treat it like playing slots: a small power-efficient rig running 24/7, just in case.
* others want to avoid pool centralization (big players like foundry usa control over 30% of the network hashrate).

and hey, **this story proves it’s not impossible.**

the bigger picture is the following:

this block win isn’t just about money. it’s a symbolic victory.

1. it proves bitcoin mining is still *open to everyone* (technically).
2. it shows that, *however small*, **decentralization is alive**.
3. it reminds us that bitcoin’s structure allows for some crazy edge-case miracles.

it's also a reminder to never unplug that miner sitting in the corner of your garage. you never know when your 19,000-year timeline might collapse into a single lucky night.

***tl;dr***

* solo miner mined block 907,283 = $373k+ reward
* estimated odds: 1 in 260 million per block (if 1 th/s)
* it's like winning the lottery, but crypto-themed
* community response = stunned, excited and deeply nerdy
* proof that even in 2025, the little guy *sometimes* wins",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mgay35/so_there_is_a_post_describing_how_a_solo_miner/,reddit

as a result i’m seeing a lot of new crypto investors expressing worry and concern all over the internet over the weekend with this small pull back.

but, please keep this in mind… trump, via his media company, just last month raised $2.4 billion to start his own etf and whether you like him or not remove yourself from that emotion and realize this one bit of information, trump is not going to take a loss. the man has the world’s pulpit and can easily move these markets with a one minute rant. and do you see the insane amount of money these solid corporations have injected into the market? every one of them helped put him where he is today and they too aren’t going to settle for a loss. michael saylor has his ear and if saylor thinks the market needs bump you better believe that trump is going to hear about it.

‘why do you think that not only are the whales going all in but these new ico’s, etfs and hedge funds are raising debt to add to the inflows at crazy amounts?

2025-08-01 21:05:41+00:00,"finalizing the patriot act ""mixer"" rule # finalizing the patriot act ""mixer"" rule

according to the report, the white house is very concerned with how ""illicit actors, such as \[democratic people's republic of korea\] and ransomware actors, continue to use mixers to obfuscate and launder funds.""

in 2023, the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) proposed [a rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/23/2023-23449/proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions) that would require financial institutions to monitor and report transactions involving cryptocurrency ""mixers"". the white house now urges fincen to finalize its biden-era ""mixer"" rule, which applies section 311 of the patriot act to certain cryptocurrency transactions.

fincen's ""mixer"" rule would deem any transaction facilitated in a manner that obfuscates the source, destination, or amount involved in one or more transactions a ""primary money laundering concern"", regardless of the type of protocol or service used, such as:

* pooling or aggregating \[cryptocurrency\] from multiple persons, wallets, addresses, or accounts
* using programmatic or algorithmic code to coordinate, manage, or manipulate the structure of a transaction
* splitting \[cryptocurrency\] for transmittal and transmitting the \[cryptocurrency\] through a series of independent transactions
* creating and using single-use wallets, addresses, or accounts, and sending \[cryptocurrency\] through such wallets, addresses, or accounts through a series of independent transactions
* exchanging between types of \[cryptocurrency\] or other digital assets
* facilitating user-initiated delays in transactional activity

which means that fincen's ""mixer"" rule is not really a mixer rule, but really a rule that would criminalize **any attempt** at privacy on a transparent blockchain.

notably, the white house's recommendation to finalize fincen's ""mixer"" rule stands in stark contrast to its promises to protect self-custody, individual liberty, and the privacy of cryptocurrency users, which it highlights numerous times throughout its report.

the white house specifies that a guiding principle for the protection of self-custody should be the **lawful** peer-to-peer transmission of digital assets with another individual who **lawfully** self-custodies digital assets.

""illicit actors may \[...\] use defi services, **along with self-custody**, to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions in the laundering process. while there are licit reasons to self-custody digital assets \[...\], illicit actors can use the pseudonymity of self-custody and peer-to-peer payments to conceal or to quickly move proceeds,"" the report states.

to bring this into current context, section 311 of the patriot act is also the source of 18 usc §1960(b)(1)(c) that criminalizes the transfer of illicit proceeds, to which samourai wallet developers keonne rodriguez and william hill [plead guilty](https://www.therage.co/samourai-wallet-developers-plead-guilty-to-unlicensed-money-transmission/) last morning to avert a potential 25-year prison sentence.

[samourai wallet developers plead guilty to unlicensed money transmissionthe developers had reaffirmed their not-guilty plea as recently as last week. money laundering charges will be dropped as part of the plea.](https://www.therage.co/samourai-wallet-developers-plead-guilty-to-unlicensed-money-transmission/)

# expanding the patriot act and the bsa to apply to defi

the patriot act, introduced post-september 11th under president george w. bush, authorizes the treasury to implement special measures to combat the financing of terrorism. at the moment, there are five special measures the treasury may prescribe, spanning increased information collection and reporting obligations, as well as the denial of service for specific actors.

to ""protect the us financial system"" as well as the ""us digital assets ecosystem,"" the white house now recommends to ""add a sixth special measure to section 311 authorizing fincen to prohibit, or impose conditions upon, certain transmittals of funds. \[...\] this would enable treasury to target foreign digital asset exchanges or digital asset transactions involving criminal or state actors—without regard to the nature of their illicit activity.""

again, this contrasts starkly with other sections in the report, where the white house reverses a fincen [rule making](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/27/2020-23756/threshold-for-the-requirement-to-collect-retain-and-transmit-information-on-funds-transfers-and) that requires digital assets transactions over $10,000 to be reported, as well as fincen's ""unhosted wallet rule,"" which was actually [already withdrawn](https://unchainedcrypto.com/u-s-treasury-withdraws-proposed-reporting-requirements-for-unhosted-wallets/) under the biden administration in 2024.

the white house states that ""control"" should be a defining factor for whether digital assets service providers qualify as money transmitters and therefore fall under bank secrecy act (bsa) obligations, but at the same time states that fincen's 2019 guidance is not sufficient and should potentially be rescinded. instead, it recommends that congress should define asset-specific sub-types to be amended to the bsa, and that the treasury, at the direction of congress, should consider ""specified \[bsa\] obligations to actors in the defi ecosystem based on the role that they play and the attendant risks.""

why? because ""the ability to transfer assets quickly across borders and perceptions of anonymity, which appeal to many digital asset users, also make digital assets attractive to illicit actors."" while highlighting that illicit actors, such as north korea, only make up a small portion of digital asset users in overall market capitalization, it also highlights the need to combat such actors, noting that such actors often ""exploit \[...\] digital asset service providers that fail to comply with applicable aml/cft and sanctions obligations, and anonymity-enhancing technologies.""

specifically, the white house tasks legislators to ""consider specifying actors within the decentralized finance ecosystem that should have aml/cft obligations, taking into consideration those actors’ roles in the ecosystem and attendant risks."" this suggestion is specifically notable in light of the report's overall tone regarding what it describes as defi and privacy preserving technologies.

the report again highlights illicit actor's use of ""mixers, anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies (aecs), and chain-hopping—to obfuscate transactional information that may be otherwise viewable on public blockchains,"" adding that ""these tools and methods can hinder law enforcement investigations"" and can ""heighten illicit finance risks if they do not simultaneously allow for or promote risk mitigation measures.""

[what trump 2025 means for freedom of transactionwhy miners should brace for the application of sanctions law.](https://www.therage.co/trump-2025-sanctions-are-good-for-bitcoin-2/)

# implementing digital identities: from permissonless to permissioned

one of such risk mitigating measures are digital identities, the white house states.

""these tools could potentially be used by regulated digital asset intermediaries to support onboarding or by a defi services’ smart contracts to automatically check for a credential before executing a user’s transaction,"" the white house states. ""these tools could also potentially incorporate a user’s transaction history on the public blockchain into their identity profile, providing additional information to digital asset intermediaries and other counterparties on a user’s behavior and exposure to illicit finance risks.""

while the white house notes that some of these tools leverage zeroknowledge proofs to ""to confirm that their identity has been verified or subject to screening by a third party without revealing underlying personal information,"" it also states that ""access to underlying personal information could be allowed at the user’s request or with their permission.""

ultimately, the implementation of digital identities would turn a permissionless system into a permissioned system, even if privacy-preserving measures are taken.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mf89cj/finalizing_the_patriot_act_mixer_rule/,reddit

but today, much of that decentralized functionality,ike lending, trading, stablecoins, and daos, is being developed primarily on ethereum and other smart contract platforms. these ecosystems are creating real use cases that go beyond just storing value. they are expanding what crypto can do.

and yet, a significant portion of the bitcoin community rejects these developments. many btc holders dismiss ethereum and most altcoins as too centralized, too risky, or simply unnecessary. their belief is that bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized asset, is all that truly matters.

this raises an important question: if people truly believe in the power of decentralization, why oppose the platforms that are actually building decentralized applications? could it be that ethereum and altcoins represent the next evolution of crypto, one that goes beyond just being digital gold?

2025-07-31 13:32:35+00:00,"bitcoin's true potential: are we still underestimating it? over the past years, bitcoin has consistently defied expectations and exceeded even the most optimistic  ath projections. what once seemed implausible has become reality time and again, as btc has demonstrated remarkable resilience, adoption, and market momentum.

given this trajectory, the idea of bitcoin reaching $1 million no longer feels like a wild fantasy, it’s increasingly viewed as a long-term possibility by some investors and analysts. however, the more provocative question is: could it go even higher? could we one day see btc at $5 million, or even $10 million?

of course, such valuations would imply an astronomical market capitalization—well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. achieving that would require not only widespread global adoption, but a significant reconfiguration of the global financial system, with bitcoin possibly absorbing functions of store of value, reserve asset, and even partial medium of exchange on a global scale.

while such outcomes may seem far-fetched today, it’s worth noting that bitcoin has surprised us repeatedly in the past. from being dismissed as an experiment, to surpassing gold in performance, to being held by institutional investors and nation-states, btc’s history is defined by breaking boundaries that once seemed immovable. the question, then, may not be whether it can reach these prices—but under what conditions such a shift could happen.

so the white house finally released its long-promised crypto strategy paper. and while some were expecting big headlines (like a u.s. bitcoin reserve or tokenized government assets), what we got instead was… policy.

here’s a quick summary of what’s actually in the report:

🔍 **key points:**

* **cftc** will be granted authority over spot crypto markets
* **stablecoin licensing** will be streamlined and accelerated
* **regulatory sandboxes** will be expanded for developers and startups
* **cbdc is officially ruled out** — the u.s. will *not* issue a digital dollar
* no mention of any government crypto holdings (btc, eth, shib, or otherwise)

📉 **what it means:**

there’s no market-moving announcement — no surprise buying, no shib-on-the-balance-sheet moment.

but this is the kind of structural clarity that markets have been waiting for.  
if the u.s. follows through, we’re looking at a cleaner, more predictable environment for defi protocols, stablecoin issuers, and **centralized exchanges** — many of which are already adapting.

**coinbase** has pushed heavily for regulatory engagement. **okx** has been proactive with transparency reports and licensing updates. and **whitebit** has recently expanded its integrations with on-chain assets through campaign-based engagement — especially in defi-friendly regions.

some cexs are clearly preparing for a world where **compliance is infrastructure**, not a burden. the line between cefi and defi is thinning — and those who bridge it early may benefit most.

💬 lets discussion**?**

would you rather see bold moves like a national btc reserve?

we’ve been seeing recent news with coins/tokens such as even monero (xmr) being vulnerable to a 51% attack. a large xmr mining group/pool qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the monero network by using the 51% attack. they would have easily succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.

https://preview.redd.it/oky2q83aluff1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef7568d83918a7e35b526ef15996cf4476190a1

thankfully, ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?

# first of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?

51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.

# is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?

yes!

1.      with at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.

2.      they have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. essentially they can pick and choose, that is a big no no (ahhh i’ve been doing too much baby talk lately irl haha)

3.      the group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! that does not sound good because it isn’t!

4.      the entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! wow, that is a huge red flag!

# proof of work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?

proof of work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.

1.      the greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.

2.      pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.

3.      when chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (recommend reading up on bitcoin gold, they have had multiple 51% attacks…)

4.      slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. the only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…

**just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! that’s cheating!**

# how is proof of stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?

thankfully ethereum has moved on from proof of work to proof of stake with recent upgrades! instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.

1.      in proof of stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as billions of dollars for most high market cap coins or tokens. this is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!

2.      proof of stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! in proof of work, they only lose trust, what is huge improvement!

3.      validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!

4.      socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! users want attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe

2025-07-28 17:41:08+00:00,"bitcoin weekly market update, 28 july 2025 **bitcoin consolidated for another week.**

in tradfi, stock markets across the world had a good week and overall everything looks great. in the us, both the s&p500 and the more tech-heavy nasdaq 100 closed at new all time highs. there is simply nothing bearish about tradfi right now. which is exactly where we want it to be for crypto to do well.

turning to bitcoin. after breaking out two weeks ago, it has now spent two weeks consolidating in a narrow range between about $116k and $120k. on friday, the capital management firm [galaxy digital announced](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/galaxy-executes-one-of-the-largest-notional-bitcoin-transactions-ever/default.aspx) that they had successfully completed the selling of over 80,000 btc on the behalf of an early bitcoin whale. part of this sale was likely what caused the dip on early friday morning.

the fact that the market could absorb an enormous sale like this and still not move down much is a very good sign. purely looking at the bitcoin chart, it tells the same story: very much still bullish, with a conservative price target of $142k.

in the altcoin space, this week we saw a pullback across the board. so far this looks like a healthy correction, with nothing yet to suggest that the recent altcoin rally has peaked.

in summary, my view remains that this bull market is far from over. let’s see what the next week brings!

(we live in austria if that changes anything) - not australia, austria! people always mix them up so just in case.

if there is no possibility of getting the money back, my mother still wants to know what happened and if it was my brother using it for meme coins, gambling or got scammed by doing some stupid things. any help is appreciated. (i will not be giving out my key or words i don't even have access to anything other than the address)

edit: yesterday afternoon he told my mother he connected something to the account and said he's sorry and it's all his fault. wouldn't some scammer connected to the account take everything? anyways, please help me trace the transactions somehow, thanks.

have been developing bitcoin related systems since 2010 though, so know the protocol inside out.  even developed my own node once.  haven't kept up with all the latest bips, but the base protocol remains the same.

to save time and energy, almost thinking instead of developing my own crypto currency, might be best to just use bitcoin instead.  what do you think?

zcash will be valuable for the same reason bitcoin was. it introduces new virtual elements as real as nature.  thought i would share.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

much like when time and space switch places in a black hole, when money crosses the event horizon of a shielded pool its history begins an unstoppable, monotonic march toward indistinguishability.

in many ways zcash's shielded transactions bump up against the information-theoretic boundary of what it means for something to be private. it's not perfect but in many meaningful ways we simply cannot make it any ""more private.""

for example, there is no quantum computer or powerful ai that will be able to look back at the zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction. that information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. it's already gone.

2025-07-25 08:35:11+00:00,"the exemption of de minimis tax under 600$. a good policy? the white house has recently made a significant announcement regarding cryptocurrency policy, stating that president trump supports a de minimis tax exemption for small bitcoin and other crypto transactions. this policy aims to simplify the use of digital currencies for everyday transactions by potentially exempting transactions under $600 from capital gains tax. the announcement was made during a press briefing by white house secretory karoline leavitt.

why this matter: the current tax situation is completely broken for actual crypto payments. nobody wants to track and report every tiny purchase, and the irs doesn't have the resources to chase down coffee transactions anyway. this creates a weird situation where crypto payments are legal but practically unusable for normal stuff. small swaps and transactions under $600 become much simpler to handle and businesses won't worry about customers creating tax headaches

the potential issues are that people might break down large purchases into small 600$ multiple transactions. and you still need to track down taxes on transactions above 600$, so the complexity would still remain.

this could be the difference between crypto staying a speculative investment versus becoming actual digital cash. right now, using crypto for payments is a tax compliance nightmare that most people avoid. remove that friction and suddenly crypto payments make sense. 

it feels like a sensible crypto tax policy proposal. a de minimis exemption acknowledges that some crypto transactions are just... transactions, not investment activity.

anyone else think this could finally make crypto payments viable for normal stuff? or are there downsides i'm missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1m8tugy/the_exemption_of_de_minimis_tax_under_600_a_good/,reddit

2025-07-24 21:01:33+00:00,"we are in a renaissance and i think the future will play out a lot like the last one. i'm one of the earlier bitcoin investors. i got into it because i saw people moving money or value around without a bank, and i figured it was going to change everything. i got into bitcoin, ripple, and ethereum very early. the only one i've really held onto is bitcoin, which comprises most of my portfolio.



i run an ai agent firm, and i don't think people are really ready for the collision of these two technologies. let me explain why. we're in a renaissance. looking at the last renaissance around the 1500s, there was an intersection between two technological revolutions: information networks and ledgers. books could disseminate new ideas, which disrupted the catholic church's monopoly on the bible, leading to the protestant reformation. subsequently, protestants fled europe and came to america. double-entry accounting gave birth to nation-states, stock markets, corporatism, and public stock exchanges. **it completely transformed our world and scaled our ability to cooperate.**

we have this same thing now, a financial reformation, where the people no longer need the permission from an elite heriarchy to access what is essentially just a book. an important one, that can only have entries appended to. it is a revolution in how clearing is done.

i define a renaissance as an intersection of innovations in our lists and information networks. today, we've had numerous innovations. sql and relational databases have transformed our world as a list powered at light speed. the internet, telegram, telephone, and social media have revolutionized information networks. now we have cryptocurrency, which is an innovation in the ledger, and llms (large language models), creating a new intersection of technological disruptions to our civilization's core pillars.

a notable author to explore on this topic is yuval noah harari. these technologies cannot fit in the old world or old way of thinking because they give birth to new economic ideologies. just as double-entry accounting gave us capitalism, cryptocurrency will give us something else.

i believe cryptocurrencies will ultimately converge into one because these systems are identical - they are decentralized verification systems where you put a message in, and everyone on the network can verify whether your message is there or not. all 15,000 cryptocurrencies perform the same function.

ai agents won't be using bank accounts; they'll be using cryptocurrency. they will make decisions and purchases, and i don't think people realize how disruptive this combination of technologies will be. they will likely settle on one secure blockchain because blockchains are public and permissionless, and we only need one. cross-chain swaps expend unnecessary energy and resources when all you really need to verify is whether alice paid bob and if a message is hashed in the database.

the future ai agent economy will be powered by cryptocurrency. equities will be built on it. you will be investing in agents, and they will be investing in you and your businesses.

i think that is what people miss, is when we get a revolution in our information networks and our ledgers it scales our ability to cooperate as it spawns new economic ideologies. the last time we had a transition like this, things got very violent. multiple wars spawned across europe as well as witch hunts. 

we have a better collective memory now, i hope we don't make the same mistakes that lead to such violence of trying to stuff the new way of doing things into old ways of thinking.

what are your thoughts? we have to work together to figure out what our future looks like. the governments and current industry leaders wont be able to, they can't see a future without the lenses of the past. they are too vested in the old world that died over 15 years ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1m8g7hi/we_are_in_a_renaissance_and_i_think_the_future/,reddit

2025-07-24 11:03:53+00:00,"xrp etf rejected → liquidity might rotate back to btc? so i’ve been watching the xrp chart lately  and something felt off.

it gave up all of its july gains, just like that. back to july 8 levels. on the 4h, it tapped the 100 sma and stalled hard. at first, i thought it was just a typical retrace… until i saw this:

👉 the sec rejected bitwise’s “10 ex-btc/eth” altcoin etf and xrp was reportedly the main reason for the rejection.

that kind of killed the altcoin etf momentum before it even started. and if that rejection holds weight, it could send a broader signal to institutions: stick with btc, for now.

it made me think , what happens when etf-driven liquidity is denied access to alts like xrp?

well, it has to go somewhere. and the safest, most ""institutionally correct"" place? bitcoin.

i’m not saying xrp is dead  far from it. i actually think it’ll have its moment eventually. but when etf doors are slammed shut, market narratives adjust.

that’s why i wouldn’t be surprised if we see:

• more rotations from alts back to btc

• btc dominance ticking back up

• choppy price action on majors like xrp to trap both sides


if you look at etf flows right now, btc is eating up the attention. and this rejection might’ve just added more fuel to that.

not financial advice obviously, but i’m keeping a closer eye on btc now. feels like it’s quietly preparing to take the lead again while everyone else is distracted. or rather, other altcoins like bgb, bnb, or sol will likely draw more attention , with solana potentially being on the etf shortlist.

2025-07-23 11:37:09+00:00,"my zcash investment thesis - frank braun this was a good read. i think i'm going 50% into zec.   
  
it's undervalued by any metric. by the time any thesis is popular most of the profit has been made. privacy coins are so low compared to other market segments & it's the original cypherpunk ethos. satoshi would approve. 

\--------------------------------------------

  
**""this is not financial advice and just my personal analysis. please do your own research.**

i simply share my analysis of why i think that zcash (zec) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

it's also not meant as input for short-term trading, i'm not interested in that and i think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

# starting point

bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken saylor could spend.

the narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (sov) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space/) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

the launch of blackrock's bitcoin etf [ibit](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7b aum is considered the most successful etf launch *in history*.

the u.s. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**nothing stops this train.**

that means number go up for bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. with gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the s&p500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

ethereum and solana have both been underperforming bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) recently raising $500m in 12 minutes. or $600m, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

crypto twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much bitcoin is pumping. retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on x.

# a privacy renaissance?

meanwhile, the word on the street is that aml regulations are getting out of control. it's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

people have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

interacted with a mixer six years go? please explain yourself.

the eu is leading the way again in regulation with mica, the only area where the eu seems to be leading these days. this lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

# why should privacy coins outperform?

i think it's safe to say that bitcoin has been institutionalized. bitcoin maxis are cheering for michael saylor, etfs, and even strategic bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the bitcoins in the reserve. or the ones from whom the bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

there are various l2 solution trying to add privacy to bitcoin, i'll write in another post why i don't think these will add privacy to bitcoin in any meaningful way. i hope i'm wrong, though, and projects like [fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [cashu](https://cashu.me/) get mainstream adoption.

the problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

swapping bitcoin for monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

so was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

# will bitcoin dominate forever?

as i said in the beginning, bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and bitcoin got it.

the only thing that bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good l1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. we can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. it's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the l1 protocol layer, given the ossification of bitcoin.

currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): the leading privacy coin monero has only \~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, zcash, only \~1/3300th.

so why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

it's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually monero, over bitcoin. [archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archetyp_market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250m euro in revenue.

so why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? and while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. why should that change?

* the market cap of bitcoin is $2.3t
* the market cap of gold is $22t
* total global asset value is [\~$1,000t](https://x.com/croesus_btc/status/1919385198795338165)
* that is, the market cap of bitcoin is \~1/10th of gold and \~0.2% of total assets
* the market cap of all privacy coins ([coingecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4b
* the market cap of monero is $6b
* the market cap of zcash is $0.7b
* undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10t, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
* that is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than \~0.1% of offshore wealth**

due to increasing aml regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. that's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. this will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider defi ecosystem.

another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

all the kyc & aml regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the ledger email leak that happened years ago.

so hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

# zcash vs. monero

as has been argued in [another post](https://frankbraun.org/t-addr), zcash has better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of zec in circulation are currently in shielded pools. that's quickly increasing due to the ""zashi effect"" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [keystone](https://keyst.one/). ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

holding zec in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. higher tvl in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for zec. it's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

monero currently has the lead over zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare zcash shielded transaction to default monero transactions. at least until fcmp++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of fcmp++ over zero-knowledge proofs.

# the importance of ux

monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but i want to share an observation i made over the years.

open-source has been really effective in delivering superior ""base layer"" infrastructure components: the linux kernel, the gcc compiler, various programming languages, etc.

but it's usually very bad at delivering world-class ux, these usually come from companies, apple being the most famous example.

i think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great ux. nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great ux needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

given that zcash currently has the better base technology (monero is catching up with fcmp++), the war for the end user is won in the ux, and there [electric coin company](https://electriccoin.co/) under josh swihart is currently leading the way with [zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

the typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great ux and already has a ledger.

# privacy is necessary for commerce

most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

the term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

you can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is.

for example, there is good reason why a lot of hr departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. if you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like gdpr) exist for a reason. i'm not a lawyer, but i would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

just as the world wide web (using the http protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to https) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. see also: [zcash, the https of blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in january 2020).

and while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

for a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

# halvings

zcash is about two halving cycles behind bitcoin. while inflation in bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of \~12.5% to \~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in november 2024. this might serve as a catalyst for zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

the next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely \~2%.

and after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub \~1%.

bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. but from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

# tracking

of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. but picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

* btc: 118844.42 usd
* xmr: 334.72 usd
* zec: 44.23 usd

let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

# conclusion

if the network effects of bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both monero and zcash should underperform bitcoin.

if privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both monero and zcash should overperform bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising \~80% of it (according to [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

given that zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making ux advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both monero and bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

which is why i consider zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**it has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. higher tvl in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. it's a great flywheel.

the largest risks i see is that monero quickly catches on with fcmp++ and better ux, or that the recent quick ux advances in zcash slow down. for example, due to lack of funding for electric coin company, because recent [changes to the zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ecc doesn't automatically receive ""protocol funding"" anymore.

commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

i guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

until then — stay safe out there anon!""

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a few months ago, i read peter thiel’s the education of a libertarian. one line from that piece has haunted me ever since:

“the fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.”

what is that machinery of freedom?

in the same post, thiel warns against a seductive delusion:

“the future of technology is not pre-determined, and we must resist the temptation of technological utopianism — the notion that technology has a momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world.”

he’s right. progress isn’t automatic. technology doesn’t have agency. there’s no law of history that guarantees a freer or more prosperous future.

david deutsch offers the clearest definition of wealth i’ve encountered: wealth is the repertoire of physical transformations one can cause. in other words, progress means expanding what we can do. that expansion comes from creative effort and error correction—from the feedback of nature in science and the feedback of markets in society.

but that only works in a free environment.

without freedom, knowledge creation slows. markets break. progress stalls. to prevent that, we need tools that protect freedom from political interference.

that’s the machinery thiel was referring to. and the most important component of that machinery is money.

before the invention of money, trade was conducted through barter. societies had to match wants directly. economists call this the problem of the lack of double coincidence of wants. even though, in principle, anything could be traded for anything, the sheer friction in matching needs made most trades impossible.

introducing a single good as a medium of exchange (money) solved this. suddenly, prices could be expressed in a common denominator. and with prices came the possibility of large-scale cooperation. prices are signals. they convey knowledge about human preferences across time and space, much as language conveys thought. this is what makes civilization-scale coordination possible.

but those signals can be corrupted. and they have been… again and again.

throughout history, tyrants have tried to override economic reality by distorting prices. they debased currencies, fixed exchange rates, inflated supply—anything to assert political control over what is, fundamentally, an emergent and decentralized system.

fiat money is a political artifact. it’s fragile, opaque, and prone to abuse. it punishes savers, rewards insiders, and weakens the market’s immune system. it makes capitalism unsafe.

bitcoin was invented to solve this. with a fixed supply and decentralized issuance, it offered a credible alternative to fiat. but bitcoin is not private. and privacy isn’t optional for individuals who seek freedom.

during the 2022 canadian trucker protests, the government invoked emergency powers and froze transactions from 34 crypto wallets (including 29 bitcoin addresses). the problem wasn’t technical but architectural. bitcoin’s transparent ledger made censorship easy. if the state can see everything, it can still enforce compliance through physical coercion.

so what is the machinery of freedom that can make the world safe for capitalism?

it’s the next evolution of money—satoshi’s last wish: money that is decentralized, private, and scalable. money that can’t be surveilled or stopped. money that makes freedom non-negotiable.

zcash is already the most advanced implementation of this vision. it offers strong cryptographic privacy, proven over nearly a decade. and now, with project tachyon, it’s being re-engineered to scale to billions of users without sacrificing privacy.

the timing couldn’t be more urgent. ai surveillance, cbdcs, and authoritarian overreach are accelerating. wrench attacks are rising. the window is narrow. but the opportunity is real.

money is upstream of everything—science, education, energy, even morality. if you don’t fix money, nothing else can scale. if you do, infinite frontiers await.

progress needs freedom. freedom needs machinery. that machinery must include private, uncensorable money.

the future isn’t guaranteed. someone has to build it.

2025-07-20 22:36:19+00:00,"how hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of capital allocation # the greatest buyback experiment in private equity history: how hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of capital allocation

**in an era where apple's $110 billion buyback barely moves markets and private equity firms struggle with record-long holding periods, a decentralized exchange has quietly orchestrated the most revolutionary buyback program in financial history.**

while traditional markets celebrated another record-breaking year of corporate buybacks—with s&p 500 companies returning $942.5 billion to shareholders in 2024—a different kind of experiment was unfolding in the digital asset space. hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, has created what can only be described as the greatest buyback experiment in the history of private equity: a fully automated, revenue-driven capital recycling engine that makes traditional buyback programs look antiquated by comparison.

# the magnitude of the machine

hyperliquid's assistance fund has amassed more than $1 billion in hype tokens, creating a major capital recycling engine where 97% of the fees collected from users are used to buy back hype. to put this in perspective, the platform recently purchased $4.72 million worth of hype in a single day, with an average price of $47.43, while maintaining strong buyback mechanics of $2 million per day.

this isn't just impressive—it's unprecedented. when we examine the scale relative to the platform's size and age, hyperliquid's buyback intensity dwarfs anything seen in traditional private equity. the platform has accumulated over $77 million in usdc inflows to its assistance fund, with over $25 million in the past month alone, translating to an average daily buyback of approximately $1 million worth of hype.

# beyond the numbers: a new paradigm

what makes hyperliquid's approach revolutionary isn't just the scale—it's the mechanism itself. unlike traditional private equity buybacks that depend on discretionary board decisions, market timing, and complex approval processes, hyperliquid operates like a protocol-funded participant, always bidding, always buying.

using an average contract trading fee of 0.0225%, with profits distributed between hlp and af in a 46:54 split, approximately 54% ($18.79 million) enters the af fund to buy back hype, translating into an annualized net profit of $225.5 million. this creates what amounts to an auto-scarcity mechanism that not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity, creating additional upward pressure on token price.

# the private equity context

to understand why this matters, consider the current state of traditional private equity. the median holding period for a private equity-backed company reached an all-time high of seven years in 2023 but experienced a dramatic decline in 2024 to 5.9 years, while private equity firms hold more than 28,000 assets, 40% of which have been held for longer than four years.

traditional private equity struggles with what economists call the ""liquidity paradox""—the longer you hold assets, the more difficult it becomes to achieve efficient exits. firms are sitting on record amounts of dry powder while facing prolonged holding periods that frustrate limited partners and distort returns.

# the hyperliquid solution

hyperliquid has solved this paradox through what could be called ""perpetual liquidity generation."" rather than waiting for exit opportunities, the platform creates continuous value through its buyback mechanism. the automatic nature of the assistance fund's buyback activity, directly fueled by protocol revenue, creates a transparent and programmatic link between the platform's operational success and mechanisms designed to support the token's value.

this approach mirrors the best practices of traditional private equity—focusing on operational excellence and cash generation—while eliminating the industry's biggest weakness: exit dependency. every day of successful trading activity translates directly into buyback pressure, creating what doug colkitt, founder of ambient finance, calls alignment between ""a project's tokenomics and user incentives regardless of prevailing market conditions"".

# the performance proof

the results speak for themselves. hype has soared to an all-time high of $42 and is up 65% in the last month, beating bitcoin, ethereum and solana. more importantly, the assistance fund is sitting on a trove of $680 million in paper gains after buying hype tokens at an average price of $14.

hyperliquid's futures trading volume has continued its upward trajectory, recording $443 billion year-to-date in 2024, with november alone seeing a record-high trading volume of $77 billion, capturing an impressive 45% market share in the crypto futures dex market. this organic growth, combined with the buyback mechanism, creates a virtuous cycle that traditional private equity can only dream of achieving.

# why this changes everything

traditional private equity operates on a model of buy, improve, and exit. this creates inherent tension between value creation and value realization. hyperliquid has created a fourth option: buy, improve, and continuously compound through systematic buybacks.

the implications extend far beyond crypto. by purchasing and burning hype tokens from the market, supply contracts, and the proportional value of remaining tokens naturally increases. this auto-scarcity mechanism not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity.

this model addresses three critical challenges facing modern private equity:

**1. the exit bottleneck:** rather than depending on ipo markets or strategic buyers, value is continuously realized through buybacks.

**2. the lp patience problem:** instead of waiting years for distributions, token holders see continuous value accretion through supply reduction.

**3. the scale efficiency question:** the more successful the platform becomes, the more aggressive the buybacks become, creating exponential rather than linear value creation.

# the broader revolution

other crypto projects like jupiter and dydx have similar plans, with estimates suggesting various protocols will repurchase hundreds of millions worth of tokens annually. but hyperliquid stands apart in both scale and execution sophistication.

hyperliquid stands apart from the rest of the ecosystem, with no true direct comparison. the project's development has been entirely self-financed, fostering organic and sustainable growth. the revenues generated by the protocol are among the highest in the industry and are entirely reinvested into hype buybacks through the assistance fund.

# the future of capital allocation

what we're witnessing with hyperliquid isn't just a clever financial engineering trick—it's the emergence of a new paradigm for capital allocation that could reshape how we think about value creation and distribution in private markets.

the traditional private equity model, with its dependence on external exit markets and discrete liquidity events, suddenly looks as antiquated as dividend-paying utilities in a world of growth stocks. unlike dividend models, where scarcity is contingent on individual reinvestment decisions, hyperliquid's automatic burn system reinforces the network's tokenomics without relying on user behavior.

# the bottom line

while apple makes headlines with $110 billion buyback announcements and private equity firms struggle with extended holding periods, hyperliquid has quietly built the most sophisticated capital recycling machine in financial history. it's not just the largest buyback experiment in private equity—it's the blueprint for how capital allocation should work in the digital age.

the question isn't whether this model will be copied—it's how quickly traditional private equity will adapt to remain relevant in a world where automated, performance-linked buybacks have redefined what efficient capital allocation looks like.

in an industry built on the promise of superior returns through operational excellence, hyperliquid hasn't just delivered—it's created a new category entirely. this isn't just the greatest buyback experiment in private equity history; it's the beginning of private equity's next evolution.

2025-07-20 21:29:20+00:00,"will the regulated fiat stablecoins collapse the economy? it seems like any stock listed on the stock exchange can now issue stable coins, that have to be backed '100%' by safe assets like treasuries or cash. 

at face value, this would seem to be hard for the issuer or buyer to make money. he sells $1 million in coins to people, puts the $1 million in a safe account earning some low percent interest rate, and the end users who bought the coin can't speculate like bitcoin that these coins will go up in value, since they are $1 each. it seems they could only be used for sending money, like a gift card. the only way they could make money is if the the issuer gave a discount, or promised future 'dividends'. is this legal? the issuer could give a discount based on a portion of the interest they expect to receive.

it would seem that a company could instead, if it normally kept $2 million in cash to cover operations year to year, issue say $1.5 million in stablecoins, sell them at a discount, collect the millions, put them into risky investments with high rates of return, and count the cash to cover operations as the cash to cover the stablecoin instead.

this would allow the company to take riskier, expansionary bets, which might be good for the economy, until there is bad news, and the company has to pay their stablecoins off due to a run, and does not have enough money for operations, and goes under.

under bankruptcy, the new law favors the stablecoin owners, so the stock owners and commercial lenders are left out and will end up failing.

when asked why, he said:

john: “they all go up eventually. right?”

john, please. let's help our friend with some explanations.

  
**what are altcoins?**  
altcoins = *alternative coins to bitcoin.*  
they’re built for different purposes: faster payments (like ltc), smart contracts (like eth), or even privacy.  
they’re not just clone, they can serve real utility… or be memes.

  
**fun fact:**  
the first altcoin was **namecoin**, launched in 2011.  
it tried to decentralize domain names. cool idea. didn’t catch on.

2025-07-18 23:22:30+00:00,"i’ve been buying hex since 2021… and it’s forever gone down.

i am pure degenerate.

i believe this coin has the legs to run, the community to support it, and the founder to bootstrap it.

i believe richard heart moved the 80k btc.

i believe when he said he mined 300k btc in 2011 back when he live-streamed in 2019 era.

i believe we will see the most epic pump after eth tops.

i think the hex community has received the most hate and ridicule, but throughout everything, they are still here and believe harder than ever that richard heart made the best crypto products (and is still making them…. liberty finance . swap)

i’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what richard heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.

1) bitcoin.  people wanted to earn yield, so they gave their bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their btc.  guess who warned you of gemini, celcius, ftx, etc?  richard.

he actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in december 2019.  which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.

so this guy richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  

the money used to buy asics, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  a hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.

so hex is born.

2) ethereum.  best product that crypto has offered.  period.  bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  it can’t do sheet.  ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  

but them gas fees yo.  every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.

hence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  it’s not some l2 that is centralized on one dudes node.

it’s world wide. no one can turn it off.  and it’s faster and cheaper than ethereum.  so now ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  best of all worlds.  

pulsechain is born.

3) uniswap.  did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  there’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  all uni token holders are getting kucked.

so richard made plsx.  buy and burn features turned on, and cannot be turned off.  it’s the drunken michael saylor buying the plsx token forevermore with every swap that occurs on pulsechain. 

with $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, and everybody hates the chain.  imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…


so these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  but richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.


rh believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.

what other meme coin can boast such stats?

i like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  freedom to transact.

if you predict correctly, you win around 80–81% of your stake. if you’re wrong, you lose your full stake.
