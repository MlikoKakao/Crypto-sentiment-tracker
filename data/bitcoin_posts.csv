2021-05-05 05:06:58+00:00,"Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that. Let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes."

Since when are the people teaming up with those that are the root cause of their problems?

Now I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.

Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.

2022-03-25 10:26:59+00:00,"Everyone was for decentralisation until Russia wanted to sell Gas for bitcoin, now people around this sub are crying about it with comments like ""I would rather lose money and the price tanks than Russia making money from Bitcoin"" First of all, as someone from a third world country that's been sanctioned, all sanctions do is bring a famine to a country. (Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I've seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn't a fairy tail where the good side always wins.

Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they're accused of being Putin apologists.

I can't fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator ! Do you (americans) think that you, your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your government's actions in the middle east, Latin America and around the world ? Do you ?

Fuck every single government. Power to the people.

You don't understand the basics of decentralisation, it's NOT hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it. God I hate this sub lately

Edit : I mentioned the US doing far worse to point out that the American people DON'T deserve living in a famine for their government's actions, same like the Russian people or any other nation's people for that matter. Not because I'm pro-dictatorship like people are accusing me of.. but I think I won't defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it, and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as ""Puting apologist"" or ""pro-dictator"" or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock"
2022-05-27 17:28:17+00:00,"Bitcoin finally decouples from the stock market! Guys, this is the moment we have been waiting for - Bitcoin has finally decoupled from the stock market!

While the stock market has been pumping for five days straight, Bitcoin completely ignores it and continues to dump further down.

I've waited for this moment since 2017 and it has finally arrived! We did it, congratz to everyone who HODLed long enough to witness this historic moment. No more price movement following the stock market, from now on we just dump no matter what, what a blessing to be part of this community and the crypto space! God bless us all."
