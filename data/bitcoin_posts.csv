2025-08-07 18:16:03+00:00,"strike or river? which app is better to buy bitcoin long term? i’m trying to figure out the best app to buy bitcoin only (not interested in any other coins). i want to set up recurring buys with my paycheck and just keep it simple, safe, and long term.

i used to be a blockfi customer so i’m a little paranoid now. been using coinbase since then but their customer service stories have me second guessing if they’re safe to stick with long-term. don’t wanna get stuck or screwed when it’s time to sell or withdraw.

between strike and river, which one is better overall for just buying btc regularly and being able to pull out later without issues?

2025-08-07 15:44:28+00:00,"has anyone done any math on how much viable versus lost crypto is out there? i'm not an economist but i've always wondered about this idea of viable currency. i know paper money has the same issue but it feels more likely to lose access to a wallet or not being able to find or recover an old hard drive. how much of bitcoin is more or less lost forever? i'm sure there are millions of $50 bills in unopened birthday cards, more hidden and forgotten under mattresses and crawl spaces. when bank accounts go dormant that money is still known about and accounted for but what about that physical wallet that got destroyed in a fire or chewed by a dog?


also i suppose i'm curious if this really even matters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mk3ke4/has_anyone_done_any_math_on_how_much_viable/,reddit

i see this as a huge boon to the industry. if the next month or so does end up being ""the top"" and they sign this law into effect, people will be mislead thinking they are not buying at the top and end up being startled when they lose 80% of their investments when we do have a 2018 or 2022 like market crash. 

i see this kind of like the hype train leading up to when matt damon advertised during the super bowl prior to the implosion of the market. this may be that signal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mjz1j1/is_todays_expected_executive_order_like_the_super/,reddit
2025-08-07 12:14:27+00:00,"stablecoins see explosive growth in cross border business payments in the midst of ongoing volatility in the broader crypto market, stablecoins have quietly been carving out a more practical use case cross border payments. from small businesses to enterprise level remittance services, more companies are starting to turn to stablecoins like usdc, usdt, and eurc as alternatives to traditional wires and swift.

according to recent trends, stablecoin transfers now outpace bitcoin in daily transaction volume, particularly in regions where fiat access is limited or expensive. for employers paying remote staff, or businesses sourcing materials globally, this shift has introduced faster, cheaper, and more predictable financial rails.

one site i came across recently, [stablecoin insider](https://stablecoininsider.com), has been tracking the rise of stablecoin adoption and publishing some pretty insightful coverage including updates on which platforms support stablecoin payouts, regulatory shifts in different regions, and use cases across industries. it’s been helpful for staying current with this side of the ecosystem that often gets overshadowed by memecoins and speculation.

it’s interesting to see how 2025 might be the tipping point where stablecoins stop being seen just as trading tools, and start becoming infrastructure. i want to know if anyone here is already receiving or sending stablecoins for regular business payments?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mjyfrz/stablecoins_see_explosive_growth_in_cross_border/,reddit
