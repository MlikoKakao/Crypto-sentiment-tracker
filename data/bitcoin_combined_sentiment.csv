2026-01-15 11:46:04,"crypto vs. the rising dollar ... what’s next? lately crypto has been consolidating while the us dollar continues to climb, reaching levels we haven’t seen in months.

a strong dollar can create short-term pressure on bitcoin and ethereum, but it also attracts institutional capital since crypto is still seen as a hedge against inflation, which could boost demand over the medium term. 

at the same time, a rising dollar makes crypto more expensive for international buyers, and some long-term holders are taking profits, adding potential volatility. short-term traders should watch for dips, but long-term hodlers still have reason to stay bullish.

now we have bitcoin as an actual alternative to the legacy system and stablecoin yields paying 6-7% for people who want to stay in dollars, and most people still have no idea this stuff exists or dismiss it as scam because media told them crypto is for criminals. the amount of value traditional banks extract from regular people is actually insane when you stop and think about it.

not saying everyone needs to go full bitcoin maxi but the fact that alternatives to the legacy banking system exist now and are accessible to anyone with internet should be a bigger deal than it is. our parents generation had no choice but to accept getting screwed by banks. we actually have options.

a push toward $100k–$103k can happen if btc breaks and holds above key resistance levels.
on the other hand, a deeper pullback toward ~$57.8k would also make sense if momentum fades. that zone is important because it aligns with the 0.618 fibonacci retracement and the 200-week moving average, levels long-term buyers tend to watch closely.

* home screen widget
* interactive charts showing gains and losses
* full transaction history with usd value at time of each transaction

the app is completely free with no ads. this is my first ios app, so i'd really appreciate any feedback or feature requests!

obviously some will sell a bit along the way to make their life easier or to pass along the grandchildren, and then they will spent it along in unreasonable ways.

one could argue; well then these early bitcoiners just stay rich, and thats ok, they cannot really print more of it anyway, so who cares?

j’ai besoin d’aide concernant un ancien wallet bitcoin.

j’ai acheté des bitcoins vers 2013. j’avais un wallet à l’époque, pour lequel j’ai fait plusieurs copies de sauvegarde. le wallet est protégé par mot de passe (je me souviens qu’il fallait entrer un mot de passe pour accéder / envoyer), mais je n’ai plus la clé privée en clair.

aujourd’hui, j’ai encore le fichier du wallet et l’application d’origine, mais elle date de 2013. en essayant de la relancer, elle me demande de resynchroniser la blockchain, ce qui génère plus de 20 go de données. le problème, c’est qu’après extraction, les adresses affichées ne correspondent pas à celles que j’avais à l’époque.

j’ai bien une adresse bitcoin dont je suis sûr qu’elle est la bonne, mais je ne me souviens plus comment je l’avais récupérée à l’origine, ni comment vérifier qu’elle correspond bien à ce wallet précis.

mon objectif est simplement :

* vérifier que mon adresse est bien liée à ce wallet
* réussir à extraire la bonne adresse / les bonnes clés depuis le wallet
* sans faire de manipulation risquée (je sais que c’est sensible)

si certains ont déjà récupéré des wallets anciens (2012–2014), ou savent comment gérer ce type de situation (wallet.dat, vieux clients, compatibilité, outils sûrs), je suis preneur de toute aide ou piste.
