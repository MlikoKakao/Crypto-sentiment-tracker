also i am trading on kraken pro, and have dust on binance pro and revolut x. which one is the best in your opinion ? should i invest on multiple platforms or just one ? is the dust important or should i just leave it ? i want to avoid spread and big fees since i am investing small amounts (like 2-3 figures max) and it already makes huge losses at the time of purchase.

2025-08-24 09:32:14,"18; going all in hey everyone, i‚Äôm 18 years old from germany, currently in a dual study program in finance. i earn about ‚Ç¨1,000/1200‚Ç¨ per month and, for the next three years, i‚Äôll have almost no expenses.

my plan is to go *all in* on bitcoin during this time. i already have a ledger wallet, but i‚Äôm also considering a trezor model t (bitcoin-only) for redundancy and peace of mind. a bit of background: i first entered the space in 2021 - not directly through bitcoin, but through the broader crypto hype (mainly metaverse projects). since then, i‚Äôve been on and off, but now i really want to focus seriously on bitcoin and build conviction.

here‚Äôs how i‚Äôm thinking about it: even if bitcoin doesn‚Äôt perform as expected in the short term, i‚Äôll still be starting my finance career in three years at the same point as my peers. the difference is that if it *does* work out, i‚Äôll have an early and concentrated position. given my career trajectory, i‚Äôll also have strong earning potential later, so i view this as a calculated risk.

my questions:

* what resources (books, articles, podcasts, courses) would you recommend to truly understand bitcoin‚Äôs economics, technology, and history?
* for someone who studies finance, which aspects of bitcoin are most important to dig into (monetary policy, security model, macro impact, etc.)?
* from your experience, is ‚Äúgoing all in‚Äù at this stage a reasonable strategy, or would you recommend a different approach to accumulation and risk management?

i‚Äôd really value perspectives from those who‚Äôve built long-term conviction in bitcoin, especially people with a finance background who can relate to this way of thinking.

back then, i knew i had put some money in, but i wasn‚Äôt too bothered about it. as the price kept climbing, i decided to sell half of my bitcoin holdings when it reached around $30k per coin. i used the gains to buy into other cryptocurrencies, which some of i still hold today. one of them performed really well and even paid for a two-month vacation, so i can‚Äôt complain‚Äîthough i do sometimes regret selling that bitcoin early.

overall, it was my first real introduction to the world of crypto. now i‚Äôm 25, and i‚Äôve built the habit of buying bitcoin weekly.

does anyone know if there‚Äôs a **legitimate way** to recover the funds, or should i just accept them as lost forever?  
any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

most people don‚Äôt realize how deadly unemployment actually is.

üìâ research going back decades shows that in the u.s., every **1 percentage point increase in unemployment** is linked to around **37,000‚Äì47,500 extra deaths per year**.

* causes range from heart disease and stress-related illness to suicides, overdoses, and even higher homicide rates.
* one long-term study found that working-age men‚Äôs mortality risk rises **6% for each 1% uptick** in local unemployment.
* an older breakdown even estimated the ‚Äúextra deaths‚Äù as \~20k heart attacks, \~900 suicides, \~650 homicides.

üìä right now (july 2025), the u.s. unemployment rate is **4.2%** ‚Äî steady compared to last year. for context: south dakota is at just **1.9%**, while d.c. sits at **6.0%**.

üìà and here‚Äôs where bitcoin ties in:

* strong job reports = investors feel safer ‚Üí bitcoin tends to pump.
* rising unemployment = more uncertainty ‚Üí investors flee risk ‚Üí bitcoin can dip.
* btc isn‚Äôt isolated; it lives and breathes with the same macro currents that drive equities, bonds, and risk assets.

at the beginning, dogecoin was just a joke, shiba a community, pepe an internet meme. today, we‚Äôre seeing entire political families turning their image into crypto projects.

it‚Äôs both fascinating and worrying:

fascinating, because it shows how deeply crypto has entered the public imagination, to the point where politics is now using it as a communication tool.

worrying, because many people may invest out of loyalty or ideology rather than real analysis.


i want to particularly mention the world liberty financial (wlfi) project. apparently, there‚Äôs a group tied to trump that first entered crypto by investing in bitcoin, ethereum, and others, and now they‚Äôre pushing their own token. trump already had a ‚Äúmemecoin‚Äù with his name, his wife also launched one under her name, and now they‚Äôre going further with wlfi.
what struck me is the speed: some exchanges already launched it in pre-market, and even in futures (bitget, for instance). it‚Äôs no longer just about ‚Äúlisting,‚Äù it jumps straight to derivatives.

and it makes me wonder: maybe crypto will never grow beyond influence ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs political figures, celebrities, or ct influencers. influence itself is becoming the raw material of new tokens.

2025-08-24 20:14:48,"why do people buy alts when it's not alt season yet? crypto cycle seems pretty clear to me after looking back in history as well as the present. first, its btc pumping, then its eth(we are here). soon it's going to be sol and then finally alt season before the bull run ends.

remember eth during may-june when it was still btc season and eth dumped from 2800 to 2200 but btc was still around 100k? now that its eth season, eth is pumping but alts aren't pumping as much. sure, some alts may have gotten gains, but most haven't been able to beat eth gains. the same happened in 2021

the only logical thing to do after this observation seems like to follow the cycle; buy btc when its btc season followed by eth. when eth stops, then move onto other large market caps and then alts when it's confirmed alt season. this is a message to those of you who bought doge, ada, sui. have you thought of the potential gains if you bought eth instead?

edit: a lot of the comments are saying that it's ""too late"" when the cycle shifts. here's a comparison to prove that is completely wrong.

cryptocurrency	jul 14	jul 28	aug 11	aug 25

eth	$2,974	$3,864	$4,253	$4,773

doge	$0.20	$0.24	$0.23	$0.24

ada	$0.73	$0.83	$0.80	$0.91

sui	$3.5 	 $4.3	$3.9 	$3.7

even if you bought eth after 3000, you would still be in bigger profits compared to others. saying that it was ""late"" to buy eth at 3000 while holding other alts is a ridculous claim",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mz66g4/why_do_people_buy_alts_when_its_not_alt_season_yet/,0,28,1mz66g4,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9432

2025-08-24 21:02:43,"250m in crypto longs liquidated in 30 minutes.. why and what's next! a website just reported that $250m worth of long positions were liquidated within half an hour. this marks one of the sharper leverage resets in recent weeks.

the size and speed of the liquidations suggest positioning was heavily skewed to the long side. once prices moved lower, forced liquidations accelerated the decline and drained liquidity from order books.

points for traders to consider:

while $250m is not unprecedented, the concentration of liquidations in a short time window indicates crowded positioning.

events like this reduce open interest and funding imbalances, which can lower near-term volatility.

the extent of recovery will depend on how quickly order flow stabilizes.

key areas to monitor:

whether btc and eth maintain critical support ranges over the next sessions.

impact on altcoins, which often experience higher liquidation ratios.

shifts in perpetual funding rates and open interest that could show whether leverage is rebuilding.

this was a clear example of how quickly leverage can reverse market direction. the immediate question is whether this flush was a one-off adjustment or the beginning of broader deleveraging.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mz7f27/250m_in_crypto_longs_liquidated_in_30_minutes_why/,0,14,1mz7f27,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.5848

i‚Äôve been working on a small side project ‚Äî an **incremental/idle game themed around bitcoin mining**.  
it‚Äôs not a real mining app, just a game that simulates the idea of starting with a tiny rig and scaling up over time.

core loop:

* start with a basic mining rig
* upgrade hardware to boost hashrate
* prestige for long-term multipliers
* (coming soon) leaderboards

the game is currently in **closed beta on android**, free to play. if anyone here enjoys idle/clicker games, i‚Äôd really appreciate feedback on the pacing, balance, or ideas for bitcoin-related features that could make it more fun.

how to join:  
step 1: join the google testers group (required for play store closed betas)

for example, if i play the long game. if i buy $10k worth of bitcoin right now, and wait five years. it appears as if the value of bitcoin trends upwards, and the best way to make money is just sticking it out long term? over a period of 5 years, i might make 50k?

with that being said, i'm afraid if i invest 10k, i'm afraid there is a chance that the value will continually decrease and i will lose money over that same period?

2025-08-25 05:21:27,"is 0.04btc a good amount to hodl for 4 years. so as the title says ,if i put all my savings together it rounds to 0.04 btc ,but i am yet to start my career and i dont think my pay is good enough for me put something into btc every month from my pay.(current pay is very low)

basically my pay = expenditure atleast for the start of my career and my guess is it would take atleast 3-4 years to get to a decent pay so that i can put something into btc (dca monthly) 

my question is that is the 0.04btc a significant to even consider holding for without dca'ing for the next   couple of years.

any feedback is appreciated.


edit : further context , 0.04 btc is equivalent to my actual yearly pay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mzhz1w/is_004btc_a_good_amount_to_hodl_for_4_years/,0,18,1mzhz1w,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.94
