some signs that caught my attention:

**$sol broke above $200** recently, with strong momentum and bullish setups.

**$spk (spark)** is pumping post-airdrop, and its tvl just hit $8.15b ‚Äî an all-time high.

several solana memecoins are doing **3x‚Äì5x within days**.

and perhaps most surprisingly: **bitget‚Äôs new listings in july massively outperformed**.

‚Üí 1 token did a 10x 

‚Üí 6 tokens did over 3x 

‚Üí **average ath roi: \~279%**, with **\~99% still active** as of july 18.

so here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm asking:

üëâ or is this just the warm-up before a true altseason blow-off top?  
üëâ is now the time to take profits or to hold and prepare for a second wave?

good stuff: bitcoin reserve proposal - if the government starts holding bitcoin alongside their gold reserves, that would mean that btc has real value in us economical terms.

fed access for crypto companies - this is huge but boring. right now, crypto companies have to go through regular banks to move dollars around, which creates delays and extra costs. direct fed access means faster, cheaper transactions. better user experience, lower fees for us.

basically expect volatility around the announcement as markets love clarity. if this goes well, it removes a lot of regulatory overhang that's been suppressing prices. institutional adoption becomes easier when the rules are clear. one side benefit of clearer regulations is that tax compliance should get easier too. right now everyone's guessing at how to report crypto transactions, but solid regulatory framework means platforms like awaken.tax can build better tools knowing the rules won't change every six months. less regulatory confusion equals better user experience across the board.

the bottom line is that this feels like a turning point. either crypto gets the regulatory clarity it needs to explode, or we get buried under bureaucracy. the july 30 report won't give us all the answers, but it'll show us which direction we're headed.

put simply, as much as i love crypto, the current volatility and speculation of a market that is still tiny compared to more trad markets, is an ideal environment for a grifter politician like trump to make insane money  (via his family and associates) from pump and dumps, and legally; and then putting those fraud earnings into btc.

2025-07-25 04:03:52,"the bitcoin bloodbath: why whales just set the stage for a monster rally. $btc falls to 116k in minutes! what the hell just happened?



if you watched bitcoin‚Äôs price action today, you might have felt a jolt of panic. a sudden, gut-wrenching plunge that sent the price tumbling and social media into a frenzy. it looked like a classic crypto crash‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt.



what you just witnessed was a masterclass in market manipulation, a strategic ‚Äúshakeout‚Äù orchestrated by the giants of the crypto world‚Äîthe whales. and if you understand their game, you‚Äôll see this bloodbath wasn‚Äôt an ending. it was a beginning. in fact, it's the clearest sign we have that a significant price spike is likely on the horizon.



1. the anatomy of a takedown

first, let‚Äôs break down what happened. this wasn‚Äôt random selling. it was a targeted strike. using sophisticated tools like liquidation heatmaps, large traders can see exactly where massive pools of ""leveraged long"" positions are sitting. these are essentially bets from smaller traders that the price will go up, but they've borrowed money to amplify their bet. it‚Äôs risky, and the whales know it.



this week, the heatmap was lit up like a christmas tree, showing billions of dollars in these leveraged positions just below the market price. it was a sitting duck. whales began to push the price down, just enough to hit the first of these liquidation zones.

what followed was a domino effect‚Äîa liquidation cascade.

when the first group of leveraged traders was wiped out, their positions were automatically sold, adding massive selling pressure. this pushed the price down further, hitting the next liquidation zone, and then the next. it was a controlled demolition, designed to do one thing: clear out the ""dumb money"" and create a clean slate.



2. the motive: a pre-emptive strike before the fed

so, why now? look at the calendar. next week, the u.s. federal reserve holds its fomc meeting, where it will make a crucial decision on interest rates. this is one of the most significant market-moving events of the year.

whales don't like uncertainty. the period before a fed announcement is filled with nervous energy and unpredictable swings. by triggering this liquidation cascade \*before\* the meeting, they achieve three brilliant strategic goals:



\-  they de-risk the market: by flushing out the over-leveraged and panicky traders, they stabilize the market on their terms, reducing the chaos that could ensue after the fed's announcement.



\-  they engineer a discount: this manufactured crash allows them to buy up huge amounts of bitcoin at a bargain price. while everyone else was panic-selling, they were quietly accumulating, loading their bags for the next leg up.



\-  they seize control of the narrative: a sharp drop creates fear. but for those who know what to look for, it signals opportunity. the whales have now set the stage to profit from the rebound they themselves will help create.



3. the grand finale: get ready for the spike

this brings us to the most exciting part. this aggressive, strategic takedown isn't a sign of a bear market. it's the prelude to a powerful rally. having cleared the board and filled their positions at a discount, the whales are now perfectly positioned for what comes next.

the consensus is growing that the federal reserve will signal a more ""dovish"" stance, opening the door for future interest rate cuts. such a move would be rocket fuel for risk assets like bitcoin.



with the over-leveraged players gone and the market reset, there's now very little resistance to the upside. the selling pressure has been artificially exhausted. the path of least resistance is now firmly upwards.

don‚Äôt be fooled by the red candles and the fearful headlines. the game is played in the shadows, and the whales just showed their hand. they‚Äôve cleared the path, taken their positions, and are ready for the next major move. this wasn't a crash. it was a launch sequence. buckle up.

2025-07-26 17:31:36,"ethereum etfs now hold 4.6% of market cap with minimal price reaction i‚Äôve been looking more closely at what‚Äôs going on with eth etfs and honestly, i don‚Äôt think the market is paying enough attention.

while most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching bitcoin stay flat, eth spot etfs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. just on friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. and that is not random. someone is clearly building a position.

it‚Äôs not even evenly spread. blackrock‚Äôs etha brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. one fund. that‚Äôs not just a good day. that‚Äôs serious intent. etha now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. and that‚Äôs not some casual exposure either. its a major position.



after that bitwise and fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while grayscale‚Äôs ethe is still bleeding though. it lost another 23 million on friday. but even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across eth etfs stayed green. these says a lot. quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.

 it becomes clearer to me. since launch eth spot etfs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of eth‚Äôs total market cap. just on thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these etfs. so it‚Äôs not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.

here‚Äôs how i see it. it reminds me of how the btc etf flows started earlier this year. just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. eth hasn‚Äôt had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. and maybe that‚Äôs exactly why institutions are loading up now. the price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren‚Äôt even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. but when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast. and from what i‚Äôm seeing here this feels like the second one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9z73p/ethereum_etfs_now_hold_46_of_market_cap_with/,73,18,1m9z73p,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en

been thinking about bitcoin's 21m cap differently in this context. it's mathematical scarcity in a world where governments can create unlimited money. the whole decentralized thing means it operates outside banking systems that could get wrecked if debt restructuring actually happens.

during actual market stress events, we've seen bitcoin and eth move with stocks, not against them. march 2020, crypto got dumped just like everything else. so this diversification argument that institutions keep using might not hold up when we actually need it to.

then there's the genius act complicating things. all these new stablecoin regulations could actually limit crypto's usefulness during financial emergencies. the exact moment people need financial escape routes, policy constraints kick in. seems counterproductive.

like if traditional finance melts down, does crypto actually survive that or does it go down with everything else because it still depends on the same underlying systems?also while tracking portfolio performance through [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) for myself i have realized how much our ""decentralized"" systems still need centralized infrastructure to function.

novogratz isn't abandoning bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and galaxy holds 13,504 btc. but they're clearly making a calculated rotation into ethereum, now holding 64,858 eth as their second-largest position.

 while bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their btc purchases, ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. that's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.

companies like bitmine immersion with 566,766 eth and sharplink gaming with 360,807 eth are betting big on this model. ether machine is even going public on nasdaq with $1.5 billion committed to ethereum.

the numbers back up the sentiment too. ethereum etfs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during july while bitcoin etfs managed $827 million. blackrock's etha is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for eth exposure is accelerating.

what i find compelling is the yield component. bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in defi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. that's a different value proposition entirely.

they're positioning for a trend where corporate treasuries don't just store value  they actively generate yield. the genius act supporting stablecoin infrastructure only strengthens ethereum's position as the settlement layer for institutional operations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mbo6q5/ethereum_can_outperform_bitcoin_in_next_few_months/,5,8,1mbo6q5,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en
2025-07-28 20:48:11,"btc dipped after getting shafted at $119k where's the momentum going? so we just watched btc drop to $117.9k today with $47.5 million getting liquidated, and honestly this whole $119k rejection is getting concerning. we've seen this level turn into a brick wall multiple times now and each attempt is getting weaker.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

2025-07-30 20:21:13,"fed holds rates as expected but crypto markets already pricing in the boring outcome, here's what happens next so the fomc meeting wrapped up with exactly what everyone expected rates staying at current levels. no surprise cuts, no hawkish surprises, just powell doing his usual ""we're data dependent"" routine. but the crypto reaction (or lack thereof) tells us way more about where we're headed.

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,65,13,1mdhcve,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en

2025-08-03 16:58:22,"what if bitcoin stay at 120k and altseason kick in ? i‚Äôm expecting ethereum to hit around $10k (give or take) by some time in the future. one way to know eth‚Äôs strength is through the eth/btc ratio, because bitcoin is basically the standard in crypto. it's like the measuring stick for the whole market.

when the eth/btc ratio goes up, it means the market is favoring ethereum over bitcoin. when it goes down, bitcoin‚Äôs leading the way. historically, this ratio has bounced between 0.018 and 0.09. so when eth is strong, 1 eth can be worth as much as 0.09 btc. when it's weak, it's closer to 0.018 btc.

i believe history tends to repeat itself, the details might change, but the ratio usually plays out the same.

so let‚Äôs say bitcoin hits $120,000 by year end, and we get another altcoin season like we saw in 2017 and 2021, pushing eth/btc ratio climbs to 0.09 again, that would put ethereum at:

0.09 x $120,000 = $10,800.

2025-08-03 19:24:02,"""tax-free crypto"" isn't what you think, here's what these 5 countries actually offer and why most people can't use them everyone's sharing those ""move to portugal for zero crypto tax"" posts but let me break down what ""tax-free crypto"" actually means in these places. spoiler: it's way more complicated than the headlines suggest.

the reality check: most of these ""tax-free"" jurisdictions have massive catches that nobody talks about. here's what each actually offers:

uae/cayman islands: true zero tax on everything crypto-related. but you need to physically live there and meet residency requirements. uae is expensive as hell ($3k+/month minimum) and cayman islands cost of living will destroy your gains anyway.

germany: only tax-free if you hold for 12+ months. short-term trades get hammered with regular income tax rates (up to 45%). this isn't a trading paradise - it's a hodler's bonus.

portugal: used to be amazing, now it's complicated. long-term gains (365+ days) are still exempt, but short-term is 28%. the nhr program that made it attractive basically ended in march 2025. you missed the boat.

el salvador: zero tax on bitcoin specifically, but good luck actually living there. infrastructure is rough and you're betting on a country that's negotiating with the imf about their bitcoin experiment.

what nobody tells you:

you need actual tax residency, not just a visa

most countries will still tax you on worldwide income if you're a citizen

moving costs, visa fees, and compliance costs eat into savings

tax laws change fast (portugal just proved this)

us citizens get fucked regardless due to citizenship-based taxation

the harsh truth: these aren't magical loopholes for your $10k portfolio. they're legitimate options for people with serious money who can afford to actually relocate and maintain compliance.

if you're making less than $500k annually from crypto, the costs of relocating properly probably outweigh the tax savings. plus you're trading away access to your home country's financial system, healthcare, and social networks.

for most people, the real ""tax optimization"" is:

hold long-term to get capital gains rates

use tax-loss harvesting

consider retirement accounts where possible

actually track your transactions properly

actually track your transactions properly with tools like awaken.tax

the crypto tax game isn't about finding some exotic jurisdiction to escape to. it's about understanding your local tax code and playing within the rules smartly.

anyone actually made the move to one of these places? or are we all just fantasizing about tax-free gains while sitting in our high-tax home countries?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mgrzyy/taxfree_crypto_isnt_what_you_think_heres_what/,27,11,1mgrzyy,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en
2025-08-03 20:27:03,"alt season ruined by memecoins? i feel like we all wait for alt season based on the money flow crypto chart, where all the money goes into btc, then to eth, then alt season follows.

but if you take a look at eth, it hasn‚Äôt even passed its previous all-time high, while btc already surged past its 2021 ath.

i feel like instead of getting real innovation, we got pumpfun and useless coins alongside it. you see great companies releasing coins, but instead of actual use cases or innovation, they just release a memecoin that dies in a few hours at most.

i know this has always been the case in crypto, where ‚Äúreal tech‚Äù barely exists and people release coins with no promise, but now it‚Äôs amplified. they barely have to do anything to get volume, just look like a company, and you‚Äôll hit a $1 mil market cap.

2025-08-03 23:42:53,"my massive ‚Äúsleeper‚Äù $ltc (litecoin) pick that many are ignoring but will soon realize, hear me out real quick! $ltc (litecoin) is my sleeper pick of the year and beyond.

1. only 84 million max supply (scarce)

2. significance, one of the earliest crypto currencies to ever release. btc is first ever so it‚Äôs extremely significant. but ltc also holds a lot of significance being one of the earliest coins ever. (significant)

3. ltc is considered silver to btc gold, they should be considered like a married couple. 

4. only an $8-$9 billion market cap, extremely undervalued in my truly honest opinion considering it being such an early adopted coin for many years. the price spread between btc and ltc is severely lopsided and i believe ltc will eventually close the gap as a supply shock will happen at some point and many people racing to own a piece of ltc.

5. demand is picking up, new developments will come, big companies and institutions will add this to their portfolios. 

6. nasdaq has them on the list for the etf they just signed the other day. 

7. extreme amount of upside potential for $ltc considering all of these factors! 

lastly, the supply is very limited, so to those who act fast and get on board can thank me later as time goes as the supply shock occurs here with $ltc. why is btc so high in value right now, the supply shock and demand. just wait for ltc to get to this point. many can‚Äôt afford btc anymore, so what is next up, $ltc, get on it and think deeply about this post!

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) ‚Äî intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i‚Äôm using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory ‚Äî i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ‚ö°

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ‚ö°",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

the goal of these servers paying bitcoin was essentially to boost the player base as the players were being ""paid"" to play essentially keeping them ranked higher on the server advertising lists. i really wonder how many people kept their bitcoin from this era and got rich. it literally took no effort because of the price at the time to make some bitcoin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mndk3c/does_anyone_remember_bitcoin_minecraft_servers/,2,2,1mndk3c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en

so i figured i'd try again. went to sign up, and again i was rejected for...reasons. the only reason i tried again is because they responded to a review i left on google. but, alas, same exact issue and when i tried to reach out to their support email they sent me the same automated response i got before.

doesn't seem worth fighting to use the platform, even though i really liked the potential offerings! just curious if maybe anyone else had an issue like this that they were able to fix? or maybe if there's another similar option to try (i know of strike/bitcoin well)?

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

2025-08-19 01:23:40,"dca volumes per month.. how does retail dca compare to institutional buying? what do you all think the volume of dca from plebs like us is compared to institutional buying?  i know there are hourly, daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly dca from hodlers. most of btc is still held by individuals. is this the new floor to a large dip or is it really institutional and sovereign buying?

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the ‚Äú wen lambo‚Äù crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

2025-08-19 05:33:10,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we‚Äôve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

i intend to hold for a couple of years so i'm hoping to make some profit, or would it be best to sell now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mvgad1/bought_what_i_thought_was_the_dip/,0,24,1mvgad1,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en
2025-08-20 14:41:11,"ecc break probability? hey everyone, since there has been talk about quantum computers and all that i revisited in depth how btc encryption works. the weakpoint in btc system seem to be ecc (elliptic curve cryptography).

  
how would yall estimate the probbability of ecc cryptography being broken in the next 10 years? also accounting for the unknown unknowns like coming up with new tech/algorithms.  
  
ai (grok4) answer:  
""based on expert analyses from sources like hsbc, postquantum, and recent quantum research (as of 2025), the probability of ecc being broken in the next 10 years is estimated at 20-30%, factoring in quantum advances and unknown unknowns like unforeseen breakthroughs. if broken, btc's secp256k1 keys could be compromised, risking theft. the network would likely hard fork to quantum-resistant crypto like xmss or dilithium to secure funds.""

damn, 30% seems alot. i really hope somebody here will have a good counterargument why its not likely to happen soon (50+ years).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mvgowa/ecc_break_probability/,0,8,1mvgowa,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en
