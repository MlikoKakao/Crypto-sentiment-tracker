what p2p is legit to use it?
i have money on uk bank account and want to make bank transfer in exchange btc.

i noticed guy who answer on posts like mine with links and description like robosat or bisq etc. 

but when i google them, lot of people say about scams, that page is llm generated etc. 

i cannot use exchanges because, i have closed account by revolut, and zempler bank and monzo. reason? no reason, they wrote base on policy which is defined so broadly that my assumption is they just do not like crypto. i did verification, face and id checks, address on 8th of jan and 9th i tried to buy for try 50 gbp then next day account restricted, withdraw money before 6th of february. 

that is ridiculous.

money legit, proof of funds, as are from sfe, and i wanted to buy to invest. but banks do not allow me to. 

is there any p2p where someone been using?

i do not want to pay in deposits in order to buy like robotsats, before buy i need to pay deposit to prevent malicious fake orders which will bump up prices. i have funds and someone have btc and that is it. deal or no deal.

can anyone help? 

banks and governments restricted exchanges, put  marketing that this is scammers tools to steal, and they blocking from purchase. now they put tax on it.

2026-01-12 09:53:05+00:00,"the real risk to your crypto seed phrase isn’t hackers or fires — it’s moving house when people talk about bitcoin self-custody risks, the same scenarios always come up: hackers, malware, house fires, floods. all real risks, sure.

but there’s one risk that almost never gets mentioned, despite being far more likely: **moving**.

in most european countries (including spain), people move houses around **3–4 times during their lives** on average. that means boxes, stress, rushed decisions, storage units, “important stuff” getting mixed with junk, and things not being touched for years.

now think about how most people store their seed phrases:

* paper backups
* notebooks
* envelopes
* usb sticks

these are technically offline, but they rely entirely on **perfect human behavior during chaotic moments**.

the probability of your house burning down is low.  
the probability that you’ll move multiple times? almost guaranteed.

this isn’t a cryptography problem. bitcoin works fine.  
it’s a **human systems problem**.

self-custody assumes:

* you’ll remember where things are
* you won’t accidentally throw them away
* other people won’t touch them
* future-you will understand past-you’s organization

that assumption breaks down fast in real life.

i’m curious how people here think about this.  
do you treat moving, reorganizing, or life changes as part of your threat model?  
or do you mainly plan for extreme edge cases like fires and hacks?

genuine discussion question — not selling anything, just interested in how others approach this.

wondering if anyone else has done similar things? 

the whole argument made by bitcoin purists to only hold real bitcoin is silly imo. when the real risk of losing your keys via house fire etc is much greater than blackrock losing or dumping their holdings.

plus with ibit i can run the wheel strategy on ibit as an income vehicle. 

edit.

just to add context on why i'm considering this. 

i started buying in 2019 my average is under 30k. i only sold a small piece of my holdings to close on a house when it was trading at 50k. 

currently sitting at over 300% gain so the logical thing to do is diversify out and hold half forever. also 90% of my networth is in btc so i watch the chart literally everyday like every 10 minutes.

doing this will give piece of mind and even lynn alden said she doesn't like to be 100% into anything.

bitcoin’s tight range signals potential for a breakout. key levels to watch include $87,600, $94,700, and $96,500 for next major move.

bitcoin has been in a tight range for several weeks, with limited price movement. while the lack of volatility has frustrated some traders, it may be a sign that bitcoin is gearing up for a larger move.

market participants are carefully watching for a breakout, as bitcoin’s recent consolidation could set the stage for significant price action in the coming weeks.",https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/why-bitcoins-tight-range-could-be-setting-up-for-a-major-breakout-soon/,7,13,1qah1fs,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en

instead of meme tokens or short-term narratives, the leaders are infrastructure-heavy projects focused on wallets, data layers, l2 scaling, interoperability and security tooling.

top names this month include metamask usd (musd), filecoin, starknet, hedera, chainlink, safe, internet computer, defichain, cardano and avalanche.

why this matters: sustained developer activity often leads real adoption cycles by months. before new products, new ecosystems and enterprise integrations go live, engineers are already pushing code in silence.

2026-01-12 06:49:59+00:00,"how 2025 reshaped crypto trading strategies: from robots to grid orders and ai by 2025, a growing number of crypto traders had switched to using robots. market conditions necessitated the automation of algorithms. as can be seen from the chart, bitcoin was only trending for six weeks out of 52.

sideways movement is ideal for strategies involving grids of limit orders. crypto traders take a 'long' position, opening positions on pullbacks and automatically closing them when local and historical highs are reached.

using robots enables round-the-clock trading, with profits locked in automatically and new limit orders placed immediately within the day. according to the data, the volume of trades using grid strategies increased by 97% over the year and the amount of capital invested in them doubled.

the most explosive growth, at 352%, was observed in pairs with stablecoins. thanks to their peg to the dollar, crypto traders can open sell and buy limit orders when the exchange rate deviates from $1, locking in profits when the peg disappears.
while the profit from such trading is relatively small, it is stable due to the arbitrage of the dollar peg and the predictability of volatility spikes. 

at the same time, there has been growing interest among crypto traders in more complex strategies based on artificial intelligence. large platforms offer their users ready-made ai products, including ai agents that can interact with the blockchain independently.

i would like to remind you of the fundamental principle of ai. unlike a robot, where the code is clearly written, it is a 'black box'; none of its creators know exactly how ai makes decisions.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qanyv6,3,1,1qanyv6,reddit,CryptoCurrencyTrading,btc,en
