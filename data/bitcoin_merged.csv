a strong dollar can create short-term pressure on bitcoin and ethereum, but it also attracts institutional capital since crypto is still seen as a hedge against inflation, which could boost demand over the medium term. 

at the same time, a rising dollar makes crypto more expensive for international buyers, and some long-term holders are taking profits, adding potential volatility. short-term traders should watch for dips, but long-term hodlers still have reason to stay bullish.

2026-01-16 10:07:37,"got a question: in a hyperbitcoinized world, how does wealth get distributed? hey,

this question is on my mind lately. obviously,  the early hodlers get rewarded through their hard commitment to their currency by obtaining a stagerring amounts of wealth. if\\when bitcoin becomes the world dominating currency, and everything will be measured against it, what will happen to these early bitcoiners? 

obviously some will sell a bit along the way to make their life easier or to pass along the grandchildren, and then they will spent it along in unreasonable ways.

one could argue; well then these early bitcoiners just stay rich, and thats ok, they cannot really print more of it anyway, so who cares? 

or will there be just a natural tendency to have it be difficult to hoard vast amount of wealth in a democratic system like bitcoin? that everything you do will make you probably loose money because you are inefficient and allocating your bitcoin in a way that creates more bitcoin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qec63x/got_a_question_in_a_hyperbitcoinized_world_how/,1,6,1qec63x,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9791,95505.05228747704,95838.59530769843,,40.13817531482765,-233.63749802456005,-242.6033947987408,8.965896774180749

the interest rates in switzerland are at the moment not that high. for a private loan at about 5-7% p.a. and 1.5-2% for mortgages up to 10 years, dipends on your income and the amount of the loan. i could get chf 50'000.- at a payment of chf 961.- for 5 years. best case is bitcoin goes up much earlier or something else i own and i pay it back before the 5 years. 

what do you think about the idea? my net monthly income after tax is chf 7'560.-, so liquidity is not a problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qecpwa/m31_private_loan_for_more_bitcoin/,0,13,1qecpwa,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9371,95335.25750621338,95680.1018423204,,51.224240751384826,-234.62726418300008,-237.178567024182,2.551302841181922
2026-01-16 10:42:06,"récupération et verification presence portefeuille bitcoincore bonjour à tous,

j’ai besoin d’aide concernant un ancien wallet bitcoin.

j’ai acheté des bitcoins vers 2013. j’avais un wallet à l’époque, pour lequel j’ai fait plusieurs copies de sauvegarde. le wallet est protégé par mot de passe (je me souviens qu’il fallait entrer un mot de passe pour accéder / envoyer), mais je n’ai plus la clé privée en clair.

aujourd’hui, j’ai encore le fichier du wallet et l’application d’origine, mais elle date de 2013. en essayant de la relancer, elle me demande de resynchroniser la blockchain, ce qui génère plus de 20 go de données. le problème, c’est qu’après extraction, les adresses affichées ne correspondent pas à celles que j’avais à l’époque.

j’ai bien une adresse bitcoin dont je suis sûr qu’elle est la bonne, mais je ne me souviens plus comment je l’avais récupérée à l’origine, ni comment vérifier qu’elle correspond bien à ce wallet précis.

mon objectif est simplement :

* vérifier que mon adresse est bien liée à ce wallet
* réussir à extraire la bonne adresse / les bonnes clés depuis le wallet
* sans faire de manipulation risquée (je sais que c’est sensible)

si certains ont déjà récupéré des wallets anciens (2012–2014), ou savent comment gérer ce type de situation (wallet.dat, vieux clients, compatibilité, outils sûrs), je suis preneur de toute aide ou piste.

merci d’avance 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qecqq6/récupération_et_verification_presence/,0,0,1qecqq6,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.296,95335.25750621338,95615.96175089061,,43.005077674290064,-233.86309378921578,-236.5154723771888,2.652378587973004
