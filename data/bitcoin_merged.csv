i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ⚡",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mkg02i/first_sats_from_nostr/,Bitcoin,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,0.9949,0.0901927437641723,0.8739696741104126,7.226699381135404e-07,0.4897657851361308,117466.18082017908

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

because what else is he to do? reveal who he is? get bombarded by the entire world and hired by the cia, nsa and all the other alphabet agencies to make a technology to supersede his magnum opus? no. this is his gift to humanity. no questions asked. use it or lose it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mkx366/are_long_winded_shitposts_around_the_origins_of/,Bitcoin,2,7,1mkx366,reddit,0.9926,0.1135204081632653,0.0,3.16200967063196e-05,0.2765380070649929,116473.45860121376

implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

if this theory will be proven right, it will reshape the world, hopefully for the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlg6xi/softwar_this_book_about_bitcoin_blew_me_away/,Bitcoin,283,86,1mlg6xi,reddit,-0.7031,0.0866175788497217,0.9583423137664796,-0.0008576767286285,0.0852505539718931,116397.67926922366

i’m wondering what the bitcoin community thinks about this. is the current plan — relying on transaction fees alone — the best long-term approach for security, or do you see potential challenges?

for perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth 

$1,050,000,000,000,000

a quadrillion?

that’s crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

but if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it’s 50,000 times higher

and if there’s a sliding scale 

so that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

ridiculous.

i have been investing since the beginning of 2024, the same amount in dollars every week. so far, i have only increased the amount i invest once.

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.

i’ve also been paying attention to warren’s comments about debt to gdp…specifically:   buffett described the current us fiscal deficit as “unsustainable over a very long period of time” and warned that “it has the aspect to it that gets uncontrollable at a certain point.”

that said, with the rise of ai in every aspect of every business, gdp will likely rise significantly.

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today’s 118k price is scary high, especially if you’re used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don’t look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn’t find one, unless you look back in history… lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it’s relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i’m on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc…) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850’s) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc — thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven’t heard from ai) hey all — long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i’m coming from and what i’m considering. i’ve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
• i contributed to my school district’s 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory — terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn’t appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
• i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there’s a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1–2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
• separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that’s being paid down aggressively.
• now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i’m seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i’d put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
• i’ve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don’t gamble, pay down debt, don’t lever into volatile assets. i get that. i’m asking this community for perspectives i haven’t considered — practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
• i believe in bitcoin’s long-term thesis — adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it’s likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
• i really don’t want to liquidate my existing btc position — emotionally and strategically i’d rather hold. that’s why i’m considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
• i’m disciplined on repayment timelines and i’m comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i’m trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you’d known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i’m considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this — how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says “don’t gamble.” i’m looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i’m curious about: partial loan → partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced — stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who’s been through a leveraged crypto move — how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
• i’m not asking whether crypto is risky — i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
• i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i’m trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
• i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you’re going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn’t, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i’ve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i’ll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i’ll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why — so others can learn from the outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mmvy3t/been_burned_by_my_403b_borrowed_to_buy_btc/,Bitcoin,5,22,1mmvy3t,reddit,0.9345,-0.0041635401635401,0.0,-0.0012046275078319,0.232282958082157,118706.00947854224

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the “talking points” for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: “bitcoin has no intrinsic value”. “bitcoins value is unreliable and subjective”. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, “*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop­erties that are valued by acting men.”*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of “intrinsic value”

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing. 

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.”[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok. 

the words ""intrinsic"" and “value” existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, “the philosophical definition is wrong and it’s not what intrinsic value means” is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has “intrinsic value”. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion. 

1. “subject” - any being or living thing.
2. “value judgement” - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim) 
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.) 
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently — just that we’ve never seen it happen.) 
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects. 
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects. 
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve.

strike, coinos, and lnvoltz offer powerful, free apis that make it easy to integrate btc payments into your site or e-commerce store.

these are, in my opinion, the best custodial options where you can keep small weekly amounts of btc for daily spending without much concern.

for the liquid network, i like the [sideswap](https://sideswap.io/) wallet.

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

2025-08-12 00:46:59,"beyond dca: i've hit my 6-month emergency fund goal. time to get more aggressive with bitcoin? hey everyone, i've hit a bit of a crossroads with my investment strategy and would love to get your perspective.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,Bitcoin,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,0.841,0.2068181818181818,0.7490081191062927,0.0081157502791029,0.4512355128008943,118904.68279550895

2025-08-12 13:12:44,"i built a dollar cost averaging bot, here’s what i learned (and what i wish i knew earlier) years ago, i started tinkering with the idea of automating my bitcoin investments.  
not because i wanted to “beat the market”, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton — not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to “set and forget,” but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper… but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i’m sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

if anyone’s interested, i can dive deeper into:

* how multiplier dca actually works in practice
* the mistakes i made early that almost killed the project
* why i think 90% of dca bots on the market are using sub-optimal execution logic

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let’s suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don’t want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france’s reputation for *la révolution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i’m only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,Bitcoin,0,2,1moaozn,reddit,0.9432,0.0755962688105545,0.0,-0.4178000213578343,0.15024906186318,119433.34179634372

2025-08-12 15:04:03,"how to easily integrate bitcoin payments & donations into your web app — a step-by-step guide for the crypto community hey everyone!

i’ve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you’re curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it’s a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i’ve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:  
[**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

feel free to ask questions or share your own experiences integrating crypto payments. let’s keep growing and supporting the ecosystem together!

2025-08-13 14:10:14,"btc’s bullish momentum might be far from over bitcoin has been on a tear lately, smashing through resistance levels and holding its ground like it owns the market. what’s interesting is this rally doesn’t feel like the quick, overheated pumps we’ve seen before, it feels more controlled, backed by strong market participation and real buying pressure.

zooming out, we’re still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn’t yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you’ve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

sotheby’s fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at us $23 million for instance, one never says ‘used’ referring to such items. they are always preowned.

 the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40 year old handbag. obviously it’s been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is singularly unique. created by hermès for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still  it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point, suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic hermès style.

 how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, “jewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.”

# diamonds are a single harvest 

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that’s it.

# bitcoin benefits

not “like” electricity… but behaving *as* electricity in an engineering sense:

* **btc = electrons** — the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** — the push that drives the current.
* **miners = generators** — converting real-world energy into unforgeable monetary signal.
* **financial instruments (like mstr’s capital stack) = circuit components** — switches, resistors, capacitors, magnetic fields… each shaping or routing the bitcoin current in a unique way.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it’s not a stock, not a company — it’s the base layer of a new monetary grid.

2025-08-14 12:33:24,"profusa (nasdaq: pfsa) bolsters financial strategy with $100m bitcoin treasury initiative **profusa, inc. (nasdaq: pfsa)**, a trailblazing digital health company revolutionizing continuous biochemistry monitoring, **has taken a bold step toward enhancing shareholder value with a strategic $100 million equity line of credit (eloc) from ascent partners fund llc**. announced on july 21, 2025, this innovative move positions profusa as a forward-thinking adopter of bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, aligning the company with a digital-first financial future.

the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin. **this strategy not only strengthens profusa’s balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company’s prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa’s commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.** this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa’s leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa’s bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

☕ **2013** — about 1 cup of coffee at starbucks (btc ≈ $3).  
☕ **2017** — already 300 cups (btc ≈ $3,000).  
☕ **2021** — roughly 1,500 cups (btc ≈ $30,000).
