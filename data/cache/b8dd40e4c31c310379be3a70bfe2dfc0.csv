second, why shouldnâ€™t you try to make some quick profits off of some altcoins/shitcoins/memecoins, if you can? for example buy 5000$ of four or five different ones, wait for a pump, and sell it all for like 5500$, with a quick 500$ profit, and then rebuy back bitcoin and stack even more.

why would you not do this, or why would this be a bad idea?

why is it better to just hodl and going through down days and crab days when you can try to earn some money, even if itâ€™s just 1 or 2%?

for instance, i see ""store of value"" being mentioned for stablecoins... but isn't that what bitcoin is supposed to be doing as a leader in crypto?

what's the difference? are stablecoins going to overtake bitcoin, ethereum, solana, or am i missing something about their differences?

2025-07-11 13:01:36+00:00,"bitcoin: the 50-day sma is awesome? so i made a test to see how simply following the position of price compared to a 50-day sma on btc/usd.

**results:** [https://imgur.com/a/zbhmqcq](https://imgur.com/a/zbhmqcq)

it appears that this very simple **long-only** strategy has consistently beaten **buy & hold** over time, on a **performance/risk basis**.

**the rules i used :**  

* buy when price is above the 50 sma. 
* sell when it is below the 50 sma.
* position size : 100% of current capital (started with $5000)

**fees are included (0.10% per side).**

i tried a lot of different sma values, are there are multiple clusters of values that beat b&h when just buying or selling depending on the position of price from the sma.

but if the s&r for btc are the important measures even for alts, then is there any point tracking indicators on the alts? it would seem not. but this isn't correct anyway, because sometimes the alts don't move in lock-step to btc. 

in fact, if you map btc onto, e.g. nvidia or palantir, you will see that there is consistency and overlap there too. 
so then i have to wonder: *does* btc actually ""lead"" altcoins? or does something more fundamental (global liquidity?) lead all of them equally?

my main concern is that my macbook is vulnerable already  since i never took this foto and it's impossible that i dowloaded it from the internet by mistake. i know every os is susceptible to hacking... but why would they just put an image on my divice instead of stealing my passwords or getting access to my wallet directly from okx since the app is on it since yesterday. im not posting the picture because i know it could be dangerous.

iâ€™m trying to understand whether itâ€™s realistic to obtain a peer-to-peer loan in btc without collateral, and whether trust-based lending still exists in the bitcoin space. i know how risky that can be, but iâ€™m open to learning more about the safer, more structured ways people handle this.

iâ€™m not asking for a loan here, just genuinely interested in how others in similar situations approach this kind of need.

2025-07-09 14:19:41+00:00,"tesla could've made $17 billion by holding bitcoin. instead, they flinched. if they had accepted just 2% of car sales in btc since 2021 and held onto it, they'd now have around 160,000 btc - worth over $17b today. that's not a random stat. that's nearly half of tesla's total profit over the last 4 years.

but in may 2021, they stopped accepting bitcoin. claimed environmental concerns. btc dropped \~40% in days, and just like that - tesla was out.

it's easy to point fingers, but there's a bigger takeaway here:

bitcoin rewards conviction. not perfection. not timing. just conviction. if you treat btc like a trade, you'll always get shaken out. if you treat it like an asset - something to hold, protect, and build around - it will change your life.

look at how the wealthy treat real estate: buy it. hold it. let it appreciate. borrow against it. never sell. you don't sell the house because the market cools off for a year. you wait - and it pays.

bitcoin is no different. it's scarce, it's global, and over time, it's proven to outlast the noise. so yeah - tesla missed out. but the lesson stands:

don't fade on bitcoin. stack more. treat it like wealth. use it like the rich use their assets. and let time do the heavy lifting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lvjzw5/tesla_couldve_made_17_billion_by_holding_bitcoin/,62,39,1lvjzw5,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-09 14:00:54+00:00,"btcusd's strong wednesday surge â€“ my take/position hey r/cryptomarkets,

hope you're all having a solid trading day! just wanted to share what i'm seeing with btcusd right now and get some of your seasoned takes.

looking at my chart (it's a 15-minute timeframe for clear price action), bitcoin had a bit of a reset overnight, testing what looks like a pretty robust support level around the 108,400 mark. from that point, the buyers stepped in aggressively.

we've seen a really strong push upwards, decisively breaking out of what was a prior consolidation range/resistance zone (roughly 108,700-108,800). the current momentum is undeniable, and the candle formations are looking pretty healthy for the bulls.

my bias here is bullish, given the clean break and follow-through. i entered a couple of long positions earlier today, one at 108,634.84 and another at 108,642.04. both are sitting in decent profit right now, which is always nice! my eyes are set on a target around 110,478.61, riding this current upward wave.

what are your technical observations on this move? are you seeing strong volume confirming the breakout? any key resistance levels you're watching further up? always great to hear diverse perspectives on the market structure.

cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lvjjpv/btcusds_strong_wednesday_surge_my_takeposition/,0,1,1lvjjpv,reddit,CryptoMarkets
