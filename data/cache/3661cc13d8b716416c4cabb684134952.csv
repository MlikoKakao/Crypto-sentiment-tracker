the 4,000 mark is more than just a round number. it’s a psychological barrier for traders and a technical resistance level that has stopped eth multiple times in the past. break it with volume, and we could see momentum carry eth toward its previous ath and maybe beyond. fail to hold above 4k, and we might witness a sharp correction as over-leveraged positions unwind.

the current setup feels eerily similar to historical pre-breakout phases, where consolidation near a key level led to explosive upside. but the risk of a “fakeout” remains, especially if macro conditions or bitcoin price action turn against the market.

2025-08-07 14:51:29+00:00,"a deep dive into qrl: the quantum-safe blockchain quantum computing is no longer science fiction — it’s progressing fast. and with it comes a very real threat to the cryptography that underpins nearly every blockchain in existence.  
  
so… if quantum risk is inevitable, where do you place your bet? and is $qrl the most credible hedge in the entire crypto space? let’s break it down.  


**my discovery of quantum resistant crypto**

i’ve been interested in quantum computing for years, even investing in quantum tech etfs recently. it was clear that fields like medicine and energy would benefit from quantum — but then i started wondering about crypto. if quantum computers can break encryption that traditional systems can’t, what does that mean for bitcoin, ethereum, and the rest?  
  
i quickly learned that ecdsa, used to secure most blockchains, is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks. at first, i assumed the fix would be simple — just upgrade the cryptography. but once i dug deeper, it became clear that upgrading legacy chains would be a slow, messy process requiring global coordination.  
that led me to explore projects focused on quantum security from the start. i found a few — qrl, qanx, and cell — and eventually concluded that qrl is the most credible bet in my opinion. it’s a purpose-built blockchain using xmss at the protocol level, and the community is focused, technical, and refreshingly hype-free.  


**qrl is built different: quantum security at the core**

while most blockchains still rely on outdated signature schemes like ecdsa, qrl has used xmss — a hash-based, quantum-resistant signature algorithm — from the start. this means it doesn’t just talk about post-quantum security. it runs on it.  
  
xmss is secure against quantum attacks and doesn’t rely on factorization or elliptic curves — the very structures quantum computers are expected to break. unlike the “future upgrade paths” of legacy chains, qrl’s cryptography is already designed for a quantum world.  
  
and it gets better.  
  
with the upcoming zond platform (qrl 2.0), qrl will introduce support for sphincs+, a stateless, hash-based signature scheme recently selected for global standardization. this adds even more flexibility and resilience to qrl’s architecture, giving developers the option to choose between multiple quantum-safe primitives — all without compromising on-chain security. after the update, existing wallets remain quantum-secure and can be upgraded to the new format at any time.  


**born too early**

let’s rewind to 2018. qrl launched its mainnet. it never gained much traction in the altcoin scene and flew under the radar for years.  
  
why?

* the 2018 bear market nuked everything
* quantum risk felt 20 years away
* no smart contracts, no defi ecosystem
* devs stayed heads-down, no vc or pr push
* very limited exchange listings
* bittrex listing was a hard lesson learned

basically: wrong timing, right idea.  


**the world is catching up**

quantum computing is no longer theoretical. it’s real, it’s advancing fast, and it’s now hitting headlines that matter:

big tech is all-in: ibm, google, and many quantum specific companies such as ionq, rigetti etc. — all scaling up quantum hardware year over year with massive investments.

white house warning (july 2025): quantum computers could ""derive any digital asset holder’s private key from their public key."" and ""some experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge in the next five to ten years.""

blackrock (may 2025): etf filings flagged quantum as a direct risk to bitcoin. 

elon musk asked grok (august 2025) if quantum computers could crack sha-256. grok's answer was that sha-256 might be okay for a while. however, elon didn't ask about ecdsa which is the lowest hanging fruit for quantum computer and biggest risk currently. deloitte estimates \~25% of bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum theft due to exposed public keys.

ecdsa — the digital signature algorithm used by bitcoin, ethereum, and most wallets — is exactly what shor’s algorithm breaks. and it breaks it fast.

forbes and wsj writing about quantum threats: 

* forbes: ""the quantum threat to encryption: how businesses can future-proof""
* wsj: ""here’s how quantum computing could change the world"". ""quantum has so often been spoken about as something that was always coming in the next five or 10 years,” kohler said. “the conversations are changing dramatically because it’s now no longer 10 years down the road. it’s much closer.”



**why legacy chains can’t just “upgrade”**

many assume bitcoin or ethereum will just “switch to quantum-safe” one day.  
here’s the problem:

* protocol-level changes require global coordination
* you’d need consensus from miners, validators, exchanges, and users
* every old wallet and smart contract would need to migrate
* abandoned keys could be stolen forever
* it’s not just a software upgrade — it’s a political nightmare.

even partial fixes (like signature overlays or hybrid key pairs) won’t solve the root issue. once quantum hits, it’s not patchable — it’s a chain-wide vulnerability.  
  
bitcoin developer hunter beast discusses about the topic in the bitcoin rails podcast ""make bitcoin quantum resistant - with hunter beast"".  


**centralized systems are already preparing**

meanwhile, financial institutions are already preparing for the quantum threat. unlike decentralized blockchains, banks and centralized platforms can implement post-quantum algorithms more easily, thanks to centralized control, layered security, and fast upgrade cycles.  
  
they don’t need global consensus or to rescue abandoned wallets. they can simply roll out post-quantum security behind closed doors. the hard truth? legacy blockchains are structurally less agile when it comes to cryptographic overhauls.  


**state-level threats: quiet and strategic**

the real quantum threat may not come from hackers — but from nation-states with the budget, motive, and secrecy to act before the world catches up.

***what could they do?***

* silently drain dormant wallets with exposed public keys
* decrypt sensitive communications, from top-secret memos to financial data
* harvest encrypted traffic now, and decrypt it later with quantum power

***why it won’t be obvious***

governments wouldn’t use quantum to collapse bitcoin — especially if they’ve already restricted it domestically. instead, they’d act quietly and selectively, exploiting vulnerabilities without shaking the system.  
  
the threat isn’t chaos. it’s control — and they won’t announce when they get it.  
  
during a recent u.s. congressional oversight hearing, it was noted that:  
***“we don’t even know the names of quantum computing companies in china.""***  
— fabaiquantum, jul 1, 2025 on x  
  
the united states office of management and budget has drafted a memorandum that directs federal agencies to fully migrate to a post-quantum cryptographic standard:   
***""everything must migrate to post-quantum cryptography, cryptocurrencies included.""***  
— qdayclock, jul 17, 2025 on x



**limited listings — for now**

qrl is currently listed on just a few smaller exchanges like mexc, banxa and lbank. daily volume is low, and there’s no tier-1 listing yet. it's possible to acquire qrl but takes an extra effort.  
  
a future binance or coinbase listing would dramatically increase visibility, liquidity, and credibility. as quantum security gains attention from regulators and institutions, tier-1 exchanges may start favoring post-quantum assets — and qrl is one of the few ready now.



**community recap**

despite being one of the most technically sound projects in crypto, qrl has flown under the radar for years — and so has its community. there’s no influencer campaigns, and no hype cycles driving engagement. just a small but growing base of long-term holders, technologists, and security-minded crypto users.

* the qrl subreddit remains active with updates, research, and user-led discussions.
* devs regularly publish progress on github and engage with the community through blog posts and discord.
* the team has stayed focused on delivery — not marketing.

what you’ll find here isn’t noise — it’s signal. the community is small, but conviction is high. and as quantum awareness grows, those watching qrl now may be the earliest of the early.  


**my path to qrl owner**

after doing my due diligence about qrl, what has really convinced me was project zond (qrl 2.0). if it succeeds, developers could migrate ethereum-style smart contracts to a quantum-safe layer with minimal changes. that could be a turning point — both for qrl adoption and visibility. i believe a tier 1 listing and real marketing push could follow. so i bought in early — before the headlines hit.

to be honest, the restricted market access for qrl was almost a deal-breaker. but i believed the project had real potential, so i opened a mexc account (which seemed like a good option from europe). despite the mixed reviews, everything worked smoothly in my experience.  
  
i was able to make a fiat transfer, convert eur to usdt, buy qrl, and withdraw it to my ledger after installing the qrl app. it took a bit of extra effort — but no issues at all.

my investment horizon is 3–10+ years. by then, it’s likely that q-day has happened — and it’ll be interesting to see where qrl stands. i believe the first truly quantum-resistant blockchain will have survived the turbulence and likely attracted many crypto holders looking to protect their assets. time will tell.  


  
**tl;dr**

* qrl was too early in 2018. now it might be right on time.
* quantum computing is accelerating
* legacy chains are structurally hard to upgrade
* qrl runs quantum-safe cryptography right now
* zond adds future-ready flexibility
* institutional attention is growing
* and almost no one’s looking — yet

## july payment statistics

we added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. monero

we have to start with **monero**.

it's eating up everything else in our pie chart. xmr now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

genuine props to the monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. nano

second biggest is once again **nano**. our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

it's also being integrated into btcpayserver right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the lightning network.

average btc transaction size was $24.48, while lightning's was $4.42. as expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. litecoin

digital silver **litecoin** plus the recently added litecoin mweb added up to 6.7%.

6.59% litecoin, 0.11% specifically mweb.

to be fair - we only added mweb payments about 7 days ago! read the blog for more on our mweb integration.

# honorable mention: zcash

finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **zcash** with 3.44%.

all the more remarkable given that zec payments were only added 2 weeks ago, and the much-requested shielded pay-in addresses a few days ago. 

# the full data

here's the complete breakdown for all coins:

* xmr: 52.91%
* xno: 17.71%
* btc: 10.20%
* ltc: 6.59%
* eth: 3.57%

* ltc-mweb: 0.11%
* kas: 0.05%
* egld: 0.01%
* pol: 0.01%

# kaspa, multiversx, dash, bitcoin cash

unfortunately as you can see kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

we know there are a lot of kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some kaspa people to hear how we can let kaspians know we exist!

another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was multiversx, with just 0.01% of total usage.

we know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in multiversx can get us on a podcast to explain nanogpt, we're all ears!

in a similar vein the typical payment coins like bitcoin cash and dash do not see the amount of usage on nanogpt that you would expect. we clearly need to up our outreach there!

# ""tachyon: scaling zcash with oblivious synchronization

zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. they provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. in short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

to enable this, zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. these proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. but the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-snarks](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“zk”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **we can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** we've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**now it’s time to cross the finish line.** i am proposing several protocol changes in zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. the crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that i refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. this new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** in the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. in order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “sapling” upgrade from earlier in zcash's history. back then, we set out to make zk-snarks practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. the sophistication of the sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)proof-carrying data

early in the history of zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-snarks. as mentioned, the [sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. however, zk-snarks are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. this has led to a misconception that zk-snarks are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in zcash.

in reality, we've never actually considered zk-snark verification a barrier to scaling zcash. i once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being snarkpack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

the ultimate tool for scaling zk-snark verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (pcd)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/ct10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind zcash. crudely speaking, pcd allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. this can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

pcd languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. this changed when our team at the electric coin company discovered [halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving pcd with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. as mentioned before, this led to a cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made pcd table stakes for new scalable protocols. pcd can be leveraged to make zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) as we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)communicating state changes

zk-snarks and pcd are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. however, privacy-preserving protocols like zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

there are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* how do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* how do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* how are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-snarks (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. by being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-snarks and pcd.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)shielded notes and commitments

shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [utxos](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in bitcoin. we aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-snark to prove that various rules are being followed. in order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

the commitment hides the note, but the zk-snark can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. this allows the zk-snark proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). in order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. the standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. the user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. the user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. other people use this address to make a payment.
4. the user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

this is how bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. the user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. in private cryptocurrencies like zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. in order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. this simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **as a start, we'll be assuming that zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** the on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over signal chats. in these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. it is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [uri-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

there are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. by moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) in order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. this at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)accumulators and nullifiers

in order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accumulator_(cryptography)). currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. we call this checkpoint an “anchor.” in order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

in order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. this works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-snark proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

if we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **the zk-snark helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** the nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**the scalability bottlenecks that remain in zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)oblivious synchronization

it'll be helpful to recast what a zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

the wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. in each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. in all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. as long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-snark proof and spend the funds. (the wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) this is more or less how our wallets currently work.

my vision for scaling zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-snark proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** this means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. this effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

the result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) as a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

it would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain pcd of the wallet state. this expense is not just due to the cost of creating pcd proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

however, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the pcd proofs) to a third party that i call an **oblivious syncing service**. this service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

we already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomorphic_encryption) (fhe). **but by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use pcd.** the remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. one would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

in practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. but this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. fortunately, as i'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#project-tachyon)project tachyon

this new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. the main changes involved include:

* **wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ecc has already begun exploring the incoporation of uri-encapsulated payments into its zashi mobile wallet. different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the zcash protocol. it also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** this involves implementing and deploying a pcd-based proof aggregation protocol for orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. this can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** this can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in pcd.** i've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. this will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **in-band secret distribution must be removed in zcash.** this can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **the payment protocol should allow wallet pcd state to augment the zk-snark in transactions.** this final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. this can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**i call this the tachyon project for zcash.** i'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. my goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. as with all of our previous network upgrades i'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

crucially, i don't plan to stand in the way of any other zcash protocol improvements while i see tachyon to fruition. i'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and i'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. i also have no reason to believe that tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as crosslink and zsas; in fact, i have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for tachyon.

there are many things i'll be sharing over the coming weeks. i'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that i've developed to be compatible with the orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. this should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

we live in a world where 🍆💩🧠👻 are one tap away, but **₿** , a globally recognized digital asset with a $1t+ market cap  is nowhere to be found even though bitcoin has :

\-been around since 2009

\-been declared legal tender in countries like el salvador

\-been integrated into major financial platforms

\-been traded globally for trillions of dollars

...the most common digital tools  ios, android, windows, macos still refuse to acknowledge it with a simple key or emoji meanwhile, obscure currencies, outdated symbols, and novelty emojis get full support. why?

**control over symbols is control over perception**

if something doesn’t have a symbol, it becomes harder to talk about, type, share, or normalize.  
it becomes invisible to the masses  not by force, but by friction. ask yourself:

\-why hasn't unicode approved a bitcoin emoji?

\-why don’t apple, google, microsoft or samsung include **₿** by default?

\-why do you need to copy/paste ₿ or create your own shortcut just to use it?

we're not talking about a joke coin here. we’re talking about an asset that has outperformed every major currency, equity, and commodity over the past decade.

**is this just neglect... or intentional?**

whether it's an oversight or something more deliberate, the message is clear: the system tolerates bitcoin. but it won’t *legitimize* it. and legitimacy  in a world of symbols, memes, and interfaces  begins with a single keystroke.

until then, keep copying and pasting: **₿**

in tradfi, last week stock markets had a good start of the week. then came wednesday, and the us fed announced that there would be no july rate cut. this was no surprise at all, and the markets didn’t react much. what they did react to was the following press conference, where chairman powell refused to give any promises of a september cut. this should have come as no surprise either, as powell has repeated over and over and again and again that they will always follow the data. but still, the markets were apparently somewhat disappointed, and sold off a little.

however, the bigger sell off came on thursday and friday, as trump announced a new barrage of tariffs that got everybody spooked, and as job number revisions came in much larger than expected. if we take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, so far this pull back is not large, and it could well turn into a normal correction in a strong uptrend.

turning to bitcoin, despite following the rest of the market down, it closed the week at $114k, still sitting well above the breakout point at $109k. the breakout has not been invalidated, and the conservative price target remains at $142k. so with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.

let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s news about tariffs and jobs. but for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.

serious manifesto: https://cicero.sh/r/manifesto

satirical comedy, george carlin style: https://cicero.sh/r/hows-the-ai-revolution

dev branch: https://github.com/cicero-ai/cicero/tree/dev-master

looking for a business partner / investor.  i'm tired of treading water by myself, and searching for tangible support now.  in exchange, i'll make you rich.

need at least 1 and perferably 2 btc to take care of everything necessary.  for collateral, you can have apex at https://apexpl.io/.  took me years to develop, intended to be a modern replacement to wordpress, but unfortunately never gained any traction.  beautiful software though, and i'll stand behind the quality of the engineering.  

if you're technical, just give the 4 line install that's on the home page a try and you'll see for yourself, it's really nice software.  you can have the domain name, github repos (https://github.com/apexpl/), plus i'll transfer the website and entire network of svn repos over to a server of your choice.  there's even a bitcoin web wallet package there, plus a bitcoin mixer package.

probably shouldn't say this, but for background on me, google ""jesse james british columbia murder"".  don't worry about the nazi stuff, as i can assure you it's simply not true.

i was his tech lead for 9 years.  with the current price of btc, he probably has over $3 billion locked on the blockchain by now, much of which i was an integral part in helping him make.  i can do the same for you.

i have a break through in nlp coming in as soon as two weeks if i wish.  you can see the existing version of the nlu engine at: https://cicero.sh/sophia/

new pos tagger is already done, although not published.  47k custom, hybrid and fine tuned logistic regression models, one per ambiguous word, work a charm.  far better than the existing pytorch based pos taggers out there.

from my calculations, next version of nlu engine should bring in about $3000/day in api calls, plus about $200k/month in enterprise sales.  this is supposedly the era of ai agents, except they simply don't work.  my nlu engine is deterministic, hence you can rely on it, and it will actually just work unlike the existing crap that's out there.

i can complete the manifesto with quality, we're about 6 weeks out from a general release if i really wanted.  help me help the world.  help me transform the internet for the better.  

i have the necessary skills and experience to do it, but i'm tired of yelling into the void.  support me, and i'll make you filthy rich.

terms are at your desire.  if you want a loan with good interest, investment with monthly dividends, equity, whatever suits you.  i plan to incorporate in singapore in the near future, so can issue you shares then.

contact me anytime personally via e-mail at matt@cicero.sh.  every last detail is technically mapped out in my mind, i just need to execute.  more than happy to provide my whatsapp and answer any questions you may have.

2025-08-03 05:07:58+00:00,"so, there is a post describing how a solo miner just scored a full bitcoin block reward. here is a breakdown on what actually happened and how insane it is a random solo miner just walked away with **3.125 btc (\~$373,000)** for mining **block 907,283** completely on their own, through the **solo ck pool**. that’s a win most miners can only dream of, while also being extremely rare.

this happened in **late july 2025**, and people are still trying to wrap their heads around just how improbable this really is. here's a full breakdown of how this went down, what the odds are and why it’s *technically possible* but *practically a miracle*.

# what actually happened?

* the miner was using **solo ck pool**, which lets people ""solo mine"" (that is, you submit valid shares as if you're trying to win the block reward all by yourself);
* unlike regular mining pools where rewards are split among contributors, in solo ck, **you either get the whole block or nothing**;
* in this case, the miner won **3.125 btc** (current block reward) + \~**$3.4k in transaction fees**, totaling **over $376,000** at current prices;
* the bitcoin **network difficulty** was at an all-time high: **\~126 trillion**. that means solving a block is harder than ever.

how rare is this exactly?

reddit lit up with calculators and probability charts. here’s what it boils down to:

# scenario 1 – hobbyist miner (~1 th/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260,000,000;**
* there are 144 blocks per day → daily chance ≈ 1 in 1.8 million;
* annual odds? **\~0.02% chance**, or **1 in \~5,000 per year;**

if you’re running a **bitaxe**, **futurebit apollo**, or something similar, you're statistically looking at **one success every 15,000–19,000 years**.

# scenario 2 – semi-pro (1 ph/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260;**
* annual success rate: \~**20%**, or **1 block per 5 years on average;**
* but 1 ph/s requires serious infrastructure, electricity, and cooling (100+ asics);

# scenario 3 – full-scale mining farm (100+ ph/s)

* now you’re mining a block every day or two;
* but also burning **thousands of dollars daily** in electricity and hardware depreciation.

**my point is unless you’re running an operation worth hundreds of thousands (if not millions), solo mining is more like buying a lottery ticket every 10 minutes.**

**the economic reality guys is that solo mining is almost never profitable!!!**

let’s say you’re running a 1 th/s device that consumes 100w. over a year:

* **electricity cost**: 100w × 24h × 365d = \~876 kwh at $0.15/kwh → $131.40/year

so even if the rig is cheap (\~$500), you’re paying yearly just to keep it running and you’ll *almost certainly never hit a block*. you’re losing money every year unless lightning strikes.

that said, what if you do hit?  
you're getting **3000x return overnight**. like another fellow redditor on this sub said: ""it’s the ultimate degen lottery.""

now, given all of the things talked above, why are some people still solo mining?

* some do it to support bitcoin's decentralization (proving individuals can still mine).
* others want to experiment, learn, or just take a long-shot bet.
* some treat it like playing slots: a small power-efficient rig running 24/7, just in case.
* others want to avoid pool centralization (big players like foundry usa control over 30% of the network hashrate).

and hey, **this story proves it’s not impossible.**

the bigger picture is the following:

this block win isn’t just about money. it’s a symbolic victory.

1. it proves bitcoin mining is still *open to everyone* (technically).
2. it shows that, *however small*, **decentralization is alive**.
3. it reminds us that bitcoin’s structure allows for some crazy edge-case miracles.

it's also a reminder to never unplug that miner sitting in the corner of your garage. you never know when your 19,000-year timeline might collapse into a single lucky night.

***tl;dr***

* solo miner mined block 907,283 = $373k+ reward
* estimated odds: 1 in 260 million per block (if 1 th/s)
* it's like winning the lottery, but crypto-themed
* community response = stunned, excited and deeply nerdy
* proof that even in 2025, the little guy *sometimes* wins",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mgay35/so_there_is_a_post_describing_how_a_solo_miner/,reddit
