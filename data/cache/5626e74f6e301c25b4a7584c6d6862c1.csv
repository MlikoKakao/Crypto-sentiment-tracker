2025-07-21 07:40:04+00:00,"bullish wedge forming on btc ‚Äî key levels to watch this week our analyst just flagged an emerging bullish wedge pattern on btc, and it's worth watching closely especially if you're trading around key resistance levels.

daily timeframe (bar & p&f)

so far, no daily down reversal price action remains constructive, and the structure is still intact. we're consolidating, but the trend isn't broken.

hourly congestion = bullish wedge?

here‚Äôs where things get interesting:

the hourly charts show a clear congestion zone forming what looks like a bullish wedge. the pattern holds as long as we don‚Äôt break below 116k.

the setup:

breakout level: 119k‚Äì120k ‚Äî watch for a clean move above this to confirm upside continuation

invalidation: break below 116k

this is a technically-driven trade setup, not financial advice. if you're actively trading btc or positioning into the next leg up, this might be the time to zoom in and track hourly resistance closely.

35% btc
18% eth
15% hbar
15% xrp

2025-07-20 18:57:29+00:00,"forget the blockchain trilemma: kaspa is unlocking new dimensions in crypto [https://i.imgur.com/yj69kfm.png](https://i.imgur.com/yj69kfm.png)

for a long time, the crypto community, as articulated by vitalik buterin, believed in the¬†**blockchain trilemma**: the idea that achieving scalability, security, and decentralization together was impossible, forcing a trade-off. but what if there's a fourth critical element often overlooked:¬†**sustainability**? many sacrificed decentralization with proof-of-stake, some compromised security and hindered speed with sharding, and others opted for layer 2 solutions.

let's find out how kaspa offers a much better balance than other projects, tackling not just the original three, but adding sustainability to the mix.

# 1. decentralization that works

kaspa launched 100% fair with no shady pre-mines, no vc handouts, and no insider deals. it is truly permissionless, relying on pure **proof-of-work** mining, meaning anyone can join and run a node. thanks to kaspa‚Äôs fast block times, solo mining is a thing - it's actually profitable, giving individuals a real shot without relying on mining pools. with kaspa, the power stays distributed. it‚Äôs the people's crypto, and always will be.

# 2. security at warp speed

thanks to its revolutionary¬†**ghostdag**¬†protocol, co-authored by computer scientist yonatan sompolinsky (whose work contributed to bitcoin through academic papers, and his ghost protocol was even used in ethereum), kaspa maintains incredible security. this means your transactions are confirmed with the highest level of trust. no more wondering if your funds are safe.

# 3. scalability unlocked

traditional blockchains are like a single-lane road, getting congested quickly. kaspa's **blockdag** technology is like building a multi-lane highway, allowing multiple blocks to be created and confirmed in parallel. this isn't some theoretical promise; kaspa is already handling thousands of transactions per second, blowing past networks like solana *without* resorting to tricks like inflated voting transactions to pump tps. we're talking real, uncompromised speed, with 10 blocks per second today and 100 bps coming!

for context,¬†[kaspa ranks as the fastest layer 1 crypto](https://kaspahub.org/article/fastest-cryptocurrencies/)¬†among top cryptocurrencies with current 100-millisecond block times.

# 4. sustainable for the long haul

unlike bitcoin, which faces ongoing debate around its 'tail emission' and future miner incentives, kaspa is fundamentally designed for long-term sustainability. its support for¬†**pruned nodes**¬†significantly lowers storage requirements, making it easier and more accessible for anyone to run a node. this, combined with its energy-efficient design and high transaction throughput, supports a future where transaction fees become a significant income stream, ensuring the network remains strong and decentralized for generations.

**kaspa isn't just a coin; it's a movement.**¬†it's built by brilliant minds focused on creating a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and sustainable digital cash system. while the old guard is fighting over scraps, kaspa is quietly building the future of money.

don't be left behind. this is your chance to front-run the smart money.

stack. hold. tell everyone.

kaspa is the real deal.

# tldr:

kaspa's solves **blockchain quadrilemma** \- which includes sustainability, an aspect often avoided by most projects.

2025-07-19 21:29:11+00:00,"why solana might actually flip eth (and why it probably won't happen soon) look, the numbers don't lie. when you can do the same transaction on solana for cents instead of tens of dollars on ethereum, that's a massive advantage.. eth gas fees are a total pain. like, why pay a fortune for the same thing when sol does it quicker and for less? someone mentioned on one of the threads dropping $150 on a new erc20 memecoin launch and getting hit with $94 in gas fees. that‚Äôs nyts.when you're tracking all these transactions for tax reporting with tools like awaken.tax, those gas fees really add up and eat into your actual gains. solana's speed is also insane compared to eth. everything feels instant, and when you're trying to catch a quick trade or mint something, those seconds matter. the whole network just feels more responsive for actual usage.

but here's why eth isn't going anywhere anytime soon:-
the developer ecosystem is just massive. we're talking about thousands of developers who have spent years building on ethereum, creating tools, learning the ins and outs of smart contracts, building entire careers around it. that doesn't just disappear overnight.
all those dapps, defi protocols, nft marketplaces - they're not going to migrate easily. there's so much infrastructure built on ethereum that moving would be like rebuilding the entire internet from scratch.
if solana does flip ethereum, we're probably looking at 2028-2029 at the earliest. maybe longer. these things take time, and network effects are incredibly powerful in crypto. bitcoin is still #1 despite having way worse tech than newer chains, purely because it was first.

what do you think? am i missing something about why eth will stay dominant, or do you see the same shift happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m47kyq/why_solana_might_actually_flip_eth_and_why_it/,0,32,1m47kyq,reddit,CryptoMarkets

i am wanting to swap up to 0.19 btc for xrp. i hold btc on ledger but i've heard doing a swap on ledger live involves pretty high fees. is this because it's on the btc network and it's unavoidable?

anyone have any ideas on how much doing the swap on ledger live could cost?

would it be cheaper to send btc to coinspot, swyftx or kraken (i have accounts with all of these) and then buy the xrp through one of these platforms??

wurster initially revealed schwab‚Äôs plans to start spot crypto trading last november and reiterated the plans in the firm‚Äôs spring 2025 business update. at the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the us.

‚Äúour expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we‚Äôre on a great path to be able to do that,‚Äù wurster said. 

in addition to trading services, wurster revealed that schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. he said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. this suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.

‚Äústablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that‚Äôs something we do want to be able to offer,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúwe will have a stablecoin at some point.‚Äù
