2025-08-15 16:39:42+00:00,"without a hardware wallet, which is the most secure desktop crypto wallet in 2025? hi everyone,

i’m currently exploring desktop wallets for storing my crypto securely, but i don’t have a hardware wallet yet. i understand hardware wallets (like ledger, trezor, etc.) offer the best protection, but for now i’m looking for the most secure software-only desktop wallet i can use in 2025.

here’s what i’m considering so far:

exodus – great ui, multi-asset, but closed-source.

electrum – bitcoin-focused, open-source, trusted for years.

guarda – multi-crypto, staking features.

coinomirk support.


my main priorities:

1. security (open-source, strong encryption, track record)


2. desktop availability (windows, macos, or linux)


3. good community reputation


4. ease of backup & recover

i truly believe in the short to medium term there will be some sort of systemic shock, a point when the debt we have collected has come due and becomes untenable to pay it. some institutions and even countries have seen it by buying hard assets like gold, bitcoin and even stakes in companies or land. my question is, if you were a banker how would you see your institution trying to work with it? self custody a butt ton of btc and back accounts with it? buy gold? strategy shares or options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mqyzx7/game_time_if_you_were_a_banker_how_would_you/,43,67,1mqyzx7,reddit,Bitcoin

2025-08-15 10:16:06+00:00,"google invests in bitcoin mining firm through $3.7 billion partnership google's recent investment in bitcoin miner terawulf is a strategic move, not a direct bet on bitcoin. as part of a larger $3.7 billion, 10-year deal, google is acquiring an 8% equity stake in the company. this isn't about entering the crypto mining business; it's about securing essential infrastructure for the booming ai sector.

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

following my last reddit post and your advice, i’ve changed my approach to self-custody.

check out my new paranoid setup:

i have a hidden bitcoin knots full node (running over tor) on a small home server.

on a bootable usb stick, i use tails os with no data persistence, and sparrow wallet installs automatically at every startup.
this sparrow wallet connects to my node to see and send transactions. it’s a 2-of-3 multisig with three physical hardware wallets.
each seed is engraved on a metal plate, with each one stored in a different location, extremely well hidden. a family member knows the location of one, my wife knows another, and my son knows the last one (and i know all three). they’re fully aware of the absolute necessity of never mentioning them to anyone under any circumstances, and a detailed procedure explaining how to recover the funds will be sent to them upon my death.

to maximize privacy, i have another single-sig hardware wallet that serves as a hot wallet. that’s the one that receives btc purchases from exchanges, and from there i send the funds on-chain to my true cold wallet, using a different public key each time.

do you see any areas for improvement?
