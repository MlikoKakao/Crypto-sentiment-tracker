hey everyone,  
bitsend is the world‚Äôs first truly offline-capable bitcoin wallet.

i just want to share something i‚Äôve been working on for a long time.  
i‚Äôm not a genius, i‚Äôm not backed by a big company, i‚Äôm just a regular guy who managed to build something new step by step, alone, with passion and persistence.

what you will see in this video is not just an app ‚Äì it‚Äôs a whole ecosystem i created from scratch. the goal was simple:

* to make bitcoin transactions possible even without internet, instantly.
* to give users full privacy and security, since everything works offline by default.
* to prove that a new hybrid model (cold‚Äìhot wallet in one) is possible.

this is only a **proof of concept on testnet**, but it shows that bitcoin can be broadcast and managed in ways that weren‚Äôt available before.

i know some will doubt, some will criticize, but for me this is just the beginning. i wanted to share it here 

this is a proof of concept demo running on testnet.  



features shown in this demo:  

\- offline balance check  

\- offline transaction signing  

\- automatic relay to the bitcoin network (without user internet)  



this is not just an app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full ecosystem that works even in crisis or without internet access.  

future versions will support multi-token and fiat integrations.

i'm not daring enough to claim it's the first magnetic board. however, i think it could be ""one of the first,"" as i haven't found one online.

it's the boards to attatch the green and red bars to update the in-game prices in real time.

its core concept is to survive against inflation and collect the most wealth points to be a winner.

we've hosted a big event in thailand to let people test the game with more than 200+ joining in. and the feedback is almost all positive.

it's on the less than 25 hours final kickstarter day to end the campaign, so you could check it out.

1. if all but one piece of hardware storing the bitcoin blockchain network were destroyed, would it be possible to recover all blockchain network data using just that one piece? how long would that take?



2. if a coin with a fixed issuance amount and a more efficient blockchain network than bitcoin were to emerge, wouldn't bitcoin's value fall from its current level?



3. as technologies like quantum computers advance, won't blockchain technology also face the risk of security hacking?
