unlike fiat, it doesn‚Äôt ask for approval. 
unlike gold, it doesn‚Äôt need physical custody. and unlike banks, it doesn‚Äôt care where you live or what passport you hold.

for once, the government couldn‚Äôt gatekeep the rails of money.

people would also probably find it hard to believe that semi-casual space travel would be a thing.

2025-08-09 04:10:21,"softwar: this book about bitcoin blew me away i recommended this book when i only started it to few crypto friends and now that i finished it (and i‚Äôm completely blow away by it‚Äôs potential
implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don‚Äôt protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin‚Äôs proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin‚Äôs most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

for perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth 

$1,050,000,000,000,000

a quadrillion?

that‚Äôs crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

rough esitmates say there‚Äôs only 2.4 billion us dollars - everything else is made up imaginary dollars and debt.

but if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it‚Äôs 50,000 times higher

and if there‚Äôs a sliding scale 

so that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

ridiculous.

i say all of that to say - as many of you know - bitcoin can‚Äôt be equated to dollars

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today‚Äôs 118k price is scary high, especially if you‚Äôre used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don‚Äôt look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn‚Äôt find one, unless you look back in history‚Ä¶ lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it‚Äôs relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i‚Äôm on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc‚Ä¶) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850‚Äôs) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc ‚Äî thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven‚Äôt heard from ai) hey all ‚Äî long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i‚Äôm coming from and what i‚Äôm considering. i‚Äôve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
‚Ä¢ i contributed to my school district‚Äôs 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory ‚Äî terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn‚Äôt appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
‚Ä¢ i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there‚Äôs a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1‚Äì2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
‚Ä¢ separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that‚Äôs being paid down aggressively.
‚Ä¢ now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i‚Äôm seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i‚Äôd put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don‚Äôt gamble, pay down debt, don‚Äôt lever into volatile assets. i get that. i‚Äôm asking this community for perspectives i haven‚Äôt considered ‚Äî practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
‚Ä¢ i believe in bitcoin‚Äôs long-term thesis ‚Äî adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it‚Äôs likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
‚Ä¢ i really don‚Äôt want to liquidate my existing btc position ‚Äî emotionally and strategically i‚Äôd rather hold. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm disciplined on repayment timelines and i‚Äôm comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i‚Äôm trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you‚Äôd known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i‚Äôm considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this ‚Äî how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt gamble.‚Äù i‚Äôm looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i‚Äôm curious about: partial loan ‚Üí partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced ‚Äî stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who‚Äôs been through a leveraged crypto move ‚Äî how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm not asking whether crypto is risky ‚Äî i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
‚Ä¢ i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i‚Äôm trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
‚Ä¢ i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you‚Äôre going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn‚Äôt, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i‚Äôve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the ‚Äútalking points‚Äù for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: ‚Äúbitcoin has no intrinsic value‚Äù. ‚Äúbitcoins value is unreliable and subjective‚Äù. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, ‚Äú*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop¬≠erties that are valued by acting men.‚Äù*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing.¬†

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.‚Äù[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok.¬†

the words ""intrinsic"" and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, ‚Äúthe philosophical definition is wrong and it‚Äôs not what intrinsic value means‚Äù is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion.¬†

1. ‚Äúsubject‚Äù - any being or living thing.
2. ‚Äúvalue judgement‚Äù - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim)¬†
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.)¬†
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently ‚Äî just that we‚Äôve never seen it happen.)¬†
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects.¬†
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects.¬†
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve.

passkey:

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

so i figured i'd try again. went to sign up, and again i was rejected for...reasons. the only reason i tried again is because they responded to a review i left on google. but, alas, same exact issue and when i tried to reach out to their support email they sent me the same automated response i got before.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.redd.it//r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,Bitcoin,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,0.841,118904.68279550895

i grew up in the 80's, and whilst we were never wealthy as such, we had a decent house, two cars, we had what we needed and my dad was the only one who earned a wage. now both my wife and i work full time, and we're only just what i consider ""comfortable""... 

someone actually commented on the video saying ""its not ok"", and how they ""dont know what the solution is"" (to which i obviously replied with a one word answer), but since developing my interest in bitcoin just 18 months ago, it has become so much more obvious how gradual degradation of fiat, general complacency and a system i suspect intentionally designed to keep people working has resulted in such an abysmal situation that is only getting worse.

not because i wanted to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton ‚Äî not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to ‚Äúset and forget,‚Äù but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper‚Ä¶ but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i‚Äôm sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let‚Äôs suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don‚Äôt want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france‚Äôs reputation for *la r√©volution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i‚Äôm only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.redd.it//r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,Bitcoin,0,2,1moaozn,reddit,0.9432,119433.34179634372

i‚Äôve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you‚Äôre curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it‚Äôs a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i‚Äôve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:

zooming out, we‚Äôre still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn‚Äôt yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you‚Äôve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

sotheby‚Äôs fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag¬†dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at¬†us $23 million for instance, one never says ‚Äòused‚Äô referring to such items. they are¬†always preowned.

¬†the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar¬†hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40¬†year old handbag. obviously it‚Äôs been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is¬†singularly unique. created by herm√®s for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it¬†possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still¬† it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point,¬†suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic herm√®s style.

¬†how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, ‚Äújewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.‚Äù

# diamonds are a single harvest¬†

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that‚Äôs it.

# bitcoin benefits

i grew up catholic, and even though i am not religious now, the ‚Äúspread the gospel‚Äù mindset stayed with me.

i understand enough economics to believe inflation and currency debasement are long-term risks, and i feel a responsibility to warn people.

i live in a high cost area making $30/hr. most of my friends earn similar or less.

i believe bitcoin will capture excess liquidity over time, and that waiting could be costly.

my urgency is not always matched by their readiness. what i see as a lifeboat can feel to them like i am telling them their ship is sinking. this mismatch has made me push too hard at times.

* **btc = electrons** ‚Äî the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** ‚Äî the push that drives the current.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it‚Äôs not a stock, not a company ‚Äî it‚Äôs the base layer of a new monetary grid.

the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin.¬†**this strategy not only strengthens profusa‚Äôs balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company‚Äôs prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa‚Äôs commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.**¬†this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa‚Äôs leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa‚Äôs bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time.

2. buy a hard wallet - cold card q
3. generate a pin for cold card q and a 24 word seed phrase.
4. generate wallet address to be able to receive from river directly without a third party wallet.

to send:

1. put in microsd card for cold card q and link it to sparrow. sparrow from my understanding is a wallet i can use to receive or send out bitcoin anywhere, in my case i would be sending bitcoin from sparrow to an exchange to be able to sell if needed.

i would then stamp my seed phrase into a titanium plate and put it in a safety secuity deposit box with an air tag.

is this the process correct and the safest?

the coldcard is for convenience of being able to sign your transactions without ever having your private key at risk by putting it on an internet connected device. without the coldcard, you would need your keys to be on your computer or mobile device. this is a ‚Äúhot wallet‚Äù and not secure especially if you are storing large amounts.",https://www.redd.it//r/Bitcoin/comments/1mqdcup/bitcoin_process/,Bitcoin,2,4,1mqdcup,reddit,-0.0757,117972.50058212508

2025-08-15 10:16:06,"google invests in bitcoin mining firm through $3.7 billion partnership google's recent investment in bitcoin miner terawulf is a strategic move, not a direct bet on bitcoin. as part of a larger $3.7 billion, 10-year deal, google is acquiring an 8% equity stake in the company. this isn't about entering the crypto mining business; it's about securing essential infrastructure for the booming ai sector.

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

i just want to share my scenario right now. i am planning to dca and having a budget of $15 per week. so, for example:

btc at 100k (1st week) - i will put $15  
btc at 105k (2nd week) - i will put $10  
btc at 100k (3rd week) - i will put $20  
btc at 103k (4th week) - i will put $15  
total = $60 for a month.

please correct me if i'm wrong. but is this how dca works? and can you give me other approach or style for dca.

i truly believe in the short to medium term there will be some sort of systemic shock, a point when the debt we have collected has come due and becomes untenable to pay it. some institutions and even countries have seen it by buying hard assets like gold, bitcoin and even stakes in companies or land. my question is, if you were a banker how would you see your institution trying to work with it? self custody a butt ton of btc and back accounts with it? buy gold? strategy shares or options?",https://www.redd.it//r/Bitcoin/comments/1mqyzx7/game_time_if_you_were_a_banker_how_would_you/,Bitcoin,20,41,1mqyzx7,reddit,0.3954,117912.9386681652

i‚Äôm currently exploring desktop wallets for storing my crypto securely, but i don‚Äôt have a hardware wallet yet. i understand hardware wallets (like ledger, trezor, etc.) offer the best protection, but for now i‚Äôm looking for the most secure software-only desktop wallet i can use in 2025.

here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm considering so far:

exodus ‚Äì great ui, multi-asset, but closed-source.

electrum ‚Äì bitcoin-focused, open-source, trusted for years.

guarda ‚Äì multi-crypto, staking features.

coinomirk support.


my main priorities:

1. security (open-source, strong encryption, track record)


2. desktop availability (windows, macos, or linux)


3. good community reputation


4. ease of backup & recover
