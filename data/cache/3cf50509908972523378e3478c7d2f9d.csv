2025-07-24 10:58:06+00:00,"would anyone say this a good time to move btc holdings into alts? (eth, xrp, hbar, some others) i know, i know, nobody knows sh*t about f*ck. i just want to know if other people agree or disagree and why. with altseason now coming “soon”, and the altseason index having dropped today, it’d be a good time to make a decision if alts are going to surpass btc in gains these coming months. i’m currently 55% btc, 20% eth, 4% sol, doge, xrp and smaller amounts of a few more. if i weren’t to invest more, or even if i did, would it be advisable to cut btc in half and move to alts?

my btc is in profit, some alts are held from previous highs including dec24/jan25 so some have not recovered investment.

info: plan on selling at some point this year. i just want to take profit near the top like i haven’t in the past two cycles. then dcaing all back into btc over the next few years. 

more info: these are not large amounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m81a8g/would_anyone_say_this_a_good_time_to_move_btc/,41,78,1m81a8g,reddit,CryptoMarkets

2025-07-23 21:59:59+00:00,"white house dropping their crypto playbook july 30, what to expect? government just spent 6 months figuring out their crypto strategy and they're releasing it next week, what this could bring for anyone holding crypto or thinking about getting in.

good stuff: bitcoin reserve proposal - if the government starts holding bitcoin alongside their gold reserves, that would mean that btc has real value in us economical terms.

fed access for crypto companies - this is huge but boring. right now, crypto companies have to go through regular banks to move dollars around, which creates delays and extra costs. direct fed access means faster, cheaper transactions. better user experience, lower fees for us.

basically expect volatility around the announcement as markets love clarity. if this goes well, it removes a lot of regulatory overhang that's been suppressing prices. institutional adoption becomes easier when the rules are clear. one side benefit of clearer regulations is that tax compliance should get easier too. right now everyone's guessing at how to report crypto transactions, but solid regulatory framework means platforms like awaken.tax can build better tools knowing the rules won't change every six months. less regulatory confusion equals better user experience across the board.

the bottom line is that this feels like a turning point. either crypto gets the regulatory clarity it needs to explode, or we get buried under bureaucracy. the july 30 report won't give us all the answers, but it'll show us which direction we're headed.

anyone else watching this closely? what are you expecting from the announcement?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m7mlx1/white_house_dropping_their_crypto_playbook_july/,95,48,1m7mlx1,reddit,CryptoMarkets

2025-07-23 01:08:32+00:00,"regretting future trading i have been trading for past 2-3 months, and at start i started spot trading was going good at it for reference im a student of business have done my batch lours and aiming for a masters program, life has been good, always had money management in me and spent wisely always, i knew about crypto currencies from a long time(3 years back)but never really invested in them.
recently a friend started trading in order to preserve savings  for upcoming years so i did too
i was doing good in spot trading mainly i was investing in btc, eth and sol coin
made good amount of profits
but eventually greed took me😔
i downloaded another trading app and pulled out my some money from spot account from different application and transferred those funds to my new application futures
i started loosing money from that day
leverages took the best of me
i was stupid enough to gamble huge amounts of money
i have learned it a very hard way
i am a student and couldn’t afford losing the amount of capital i have lost so far that would be around 1000$
now im going insane and looking back to it makes me hate myself
sometimes the greed makes me think that i wish i could have went for short at that time or i wish i could have went for long at that time
anways moving forward to this day i have swore to never ever use future again no matter how lucrative they are , 
future trading is total bullshit in my opnion even if you are calculating risks and all 
it makes you cripple
whomever is reading this post of mine and is new to trading 
please i advise you to just do spot trading
in longer run you would always be beneficial from this spot trading
you have the asset in your hands no matter even if it looses it value
do dca whenever you can 
never ever go for future trading
i have roughly calculated my loss so far now its roughly 1000$ could be more
and for me 1000$ is huge amount of money

2025-07-22 15:39:18+00:00,"report by oobit shows brazil’s crypto economy believes in usdt, but can’t use it according to a [july 2025 survey by oobit](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/brazils-crypto-economy-usdt-cant-use-it/), brazilian crypto users are deeply invested in stablecoins, particularly usdt:

- 91.8% of crypto users hold stablecoins

- 83% specifically hold usdt

- 43.5% fully trust tether

yet, despite the trust and popularity, actual usage remains surprisingly low:

- only 54.3% have ever made a crypto payment

- just 37% have used usdt in real-world scenarios (either online or offline)


the report suggests the problem isn’t technological but related to product, user experience, and real-world incentives.


i'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.


if you're in brazil or a similar market, what’s stopping you from spending crypto regularly?


what would make crypto-native spending easier or more rewarding?


are we finally past the ""starbucks with bitcoin"" era, or is mass adoption just waiting for the right infrastructure?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m6hfhl/report_by_oobit_shows_brazils_crypto_economy/,44,9,1m6hfhl,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-22 14:52:05+00:00,"what if the altseason has already started — and we just haven’t admitted it yet? there’s been a lot of talk lately about how btc has ""decoupled"" from altcoins, that capital isn’t rotating like before, and that the altseason is still far away.

but honestly, looking at what’s happening across the board, i’m starting to wonder if we’re already *in the middle of it*, just in a more subtle form.

some signs that caught my attention:

**$sol broke above $200** recently, with strong momentum and bullish setups.

**$spk (spark)** is pumping post-airdrop, and its tvl just hit $8.15b — an all-time high.

several solana memecoins are doing **3x–5x within days**.

and perhaps most surprisingly: **bitget’s new listings in july massively outperformed**.

→ 1 token did a 10x 

→ 6 tokens did over 3x 

→ **average ath roi: \~279%**, with **\~99% still active** as of july 18.

i came across these stats from a tweet by [https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173](https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173), and honestly, i thought i was the only one noticing this kind of trend...

so here’s what i’m asking:

👉 **are we already in a “slow-burn altseason”** that most people are just ignoring?  
👉 or is this just the warm-up before a true altseason blow-off top?  
👉 is now the time to take profits or to hold and prepare for a second wave?

genuinely curious about your thoughts  especially from people actively trading low caps, new listings, or tracking tvl/momentum data.
