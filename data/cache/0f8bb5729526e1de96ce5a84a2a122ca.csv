i got an idea to have some sort of insurance in the case i lose my coins, while still doing self custody. in the spirit of lose your keys, not your coins, i am thinking of building this service where all your utxos in your wallet have a special script that has a spending tree where there is a fallback where my service can trigger a transfer, which activates a dead man switch where the wallet holder can cancel the spending tree during 1 month time to assure some level of trust. 

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized. 

i really want to build something on bitcoin. i am not totally convinced that it is a purely good or bad idea. what do you think? i don't want to spend much time building something stupid. feel free to be candid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mksfpi/is_my_bitcoin_idea_totally_stupid/,2,29,1mksfpi,reddit,Bitcoin

2025-08-08 09:47:38+00:00,"word-of-mouth bitcoin social phenomenon i see a lot of posts about people damaging or losing relationships due to bitcoin conversations.  often times it seems people try to ""orange pill"" their friends and often times it doesn't work.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

curious if anyone else has seen this dynamic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mkqwwp/wordofmouth_bitcoin_social_phenomenon/,4,2,1mkqwwp,reddit,Bitcoin

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ‚ö°

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ‚ö°",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) ‚Äî intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i‚Äôm using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory ‚Äî i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.
