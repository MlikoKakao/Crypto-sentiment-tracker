here's my story -- i used to discuss stock investing with a friend in singapore. he introduced me to bitcoin by saying 'i know you're an independent thinker, i think you'll appreciate this concept'. he sent me a link to the bitcoin training by britishhodl, and that's what intrigued me. then, i started watching to saylor's videos, which made my belief stronger. i also started dca-ing around mid 2024. i lean towards the dems, and when it comes to stock investing, i'm a bear. i was naive and thought that kamala would win, and that bitcoin would fall to 40k-ish range and then i'll invest. like several people, i learnt the hard way that timing the market is stupid. i started investing on the day trump won the election, and haven't sold since.

2025-08-12 00:46:59+00:00,"beyond dca: i've hit my 6-month emergency fund goal. time to get more aggressive with bitcoin? hey everyone, i've hit a bit of a crossroads with my investment strategy and would love to get your perspective.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,Bitcoin

question is, am i correct in the math and if the maths correct, am i missing anything? other than price fluctuating all the time, i guess i'm missing how much tax i'd have to pay each time i was to do this?

let's say the exchange charges 1.5%.

buy btc - $173,000
1.5% - $2595
total paid - $175,595

sell btc - $185,000

so i figured i'd try again. went to sign up, and again i was rejected for...reasons. the only reason i tried again is because they responded to a review i left on google. but, alas, same exact issue and when i tried to reach out to their support email they sent me the same automated response i got before.

doesn't seem worth fighting to use the platform, even though i really liked the potential offerings! just curious if maybe anyone else had an issue like this that they were able to fix? or maybe if there's another similar option to try (i know of strike/bitcoin well)?
