2025-07-15 01:25:24+00:00,"hit $1,100 at 16 years old with crypto — what should i do next? hey everyone,

i’m 16 years old and i’ve been learning and dabbling in crypto for the past several months. so far i’ve managed to grow my initial money and now i’ve got about $1,100 in total invested. i’m proud of getting to this point because it took discipline, researching projects, and avoiding some of the hype and scams i’ve seen online. but now i’m at a crossroads and could use some advice from people more experienced than me about what to do next and what to keep doing.

here’s a little background:
i started with just a couple hundred dollars that i saved from small jobs and gifts. i split it between some bitcoin, a little ethereum, and a couple of altcoins i researched. i didn’t chase meme coins or pump-and-dumps, though i admit i did take a very small gamble on a random token once — lesson learned. i’ve been using coinbase and i always keep my seed phrases offline. so far i’ve just been holding. i don’t trade much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m04p0w/hit_1100_at_16_years_old_with_crypto_what_should/,27,97,1m04p0w,reddit,CryptoMarkets

i've been in crypto for a while now and finally thinking about getting a crypto card to make it easier to spend without converting everything manually. mostly holding btc, eth, and some stables, and i’d love to earn a bit of yield or cashback if that’s an option.  
i’ve heard names like nexo, cdc, and binance thrown around, but i’m not sure what’s actually working well in practice - especially in terms of:  
\- ease of use  
\- fees & fx rates  
\- rewards (cashback/yield)  
\- whether it’s debit or credit-based  
\- any tax implications i should know about

would really appreciate feedback from anyone who’s actually used one for everyday stuff (groceries, bills, travel, etc.). not trying to spend my whole stack, just want some flexibility without always off-ramping manually.

bitcoin’s hitting new highs with strong buying volume but the 24-hour long and short data shows retail traders are mostly short while whales stay heavily long. since retail is mostly short here my guess is we’re probably getting shafted as usual. if btc holds support and funding rates turn favorable there could be a short squeeze that pushes prices higher but history tells me retail often gets caught on the wrong side.

retail shorts get squeezed hard when prices move against them but retail longs can also get hit if whales start unloading or the market turns. either way retail traders will most likely end up on the losing side because they don’t have the same information or patience as the big players.

2025-07-12 23:08:21+00:00,"why altcoins underperform btc: imagine permanent sell limit orders let's do a thought experiment.

currently strategy holds \~3% of bitcoin supply. average purchase price is \~$70k. michael saylor says he plans to never sell bitcoin. also, 95% of total bitcoin supply is in circulation now - only \~5% left to be mined.

what would happen if saylor changes his mind and decides to start selling, say, up to 50% of his btc holdings at exactly $120k price (as an example)? you can imagine this as a **permanent sell limit order** with the price of $120k and enormous volume (1.5% of supply). of course, technically it doesn't look like that, but conceptually it's the same: every time the price goes to $120k, the big seller would arrive and drive it back down.  
**the price would likely not go past $120k for a while** \- because even when demand grows, mstr will always be there to sell some more of their bag at $120k.

**and now imagine** if strategy held not 3%, but 30% of bitcoin supply. average purchase price is not $70k, but $7k. and saylor's goal is to make money in short/medium term, so he's ready to sell every time the price goes up. heck, he could even sell when the price is stable or goes down - he would still make a lot of money on top of $7k cost basis. just need to not sell a lot at once, because that would scare retail investors.

could btc ever keep going up under such conditions?

**this is what happens with most altcoins**. it has nothing to do with the tech itself. the tech can be awesome, but the token ownership incentivizes early investors to sell whenever the demand grows, limiting the price growth potential. and that will continue to happen until they sell their big bags, which can be 50% of total token supply, or even more.

**what about memecoins?** don't they have a more fair token distribution? not really. they still have founders and early adopters - lucky people who got 1%+ of supply each for minimal prices. when the price goes 10x-100x and the token enters, say, top 100 of cmc - they will start to sell, limiting the price growth.

how can we identify altcoins that can outperform btc in the long run? there is no guarantee, but here are a few metrics that we can look at, and compare it with btc.

**1. % of supply in circulation.** every time a token unlock happens, early investors get the token for free -  so they will always be incentivized to sell, driving the price down. if the token has, say, <80% in circulation, we can't expect the price to outperform btc just because of this reason. btc has 95%.

**2. % of supply held by whales**. a whale in cmc terminology is a wallet that holds >1% of total token supply. so if this number is, say, higher than 10%, we can expect that whale to sell when demand grows, to make profit. for btc only 1.25% of total supply is controlled by whales.

**3. historical price action in btc.** there were big waves of retail demand for altcoins in the past. we can look at price of the token in btc, not usd. for most of altcoins, it has a clear pattern: there is a surge every few years, and then a slow drop. and the surges usually get lower, and drops get deeper. unless the tech makes a groundbreaking advancement and adoption explodes, we can expect the pattern to continue. and just to be clear, the adoption has to be bigger than the adoption for btc. because the whales holding 1%+ of supply will keep selling, so the demand needs to smash past that. it's much harder for altcoins than for btc just because there are typically much bigger whales in terms of % of supply held.

here is the analysis of top 20 coins (cmc data):

|rank|token|% supply in circulation|% supply held by whales|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1**|**btc**|**95**|**1.25**|

**so is there any reason to invest in altcoins at all?**

i think the tech has potential, but projects should be selected very carefully. i don't think it makes sense to invest in projects with <80% supply in circulation (unless you're a huge believer in the specific tech) or with >10% held by whales. however, there is one exception to the last point. it is possible that the project foundation controls the large portion of supply (e.g. eth, trx), but they can be trusted that they won't limit the price action by constantly selling. i think trx is the best example of this. justin sun controls \~70% of token supply, however apparently he makes the trx price action follow the btc price, so the trx graph in btc is quite stable since \~2020.

so even though trx does not outperform btc, at least it follows it. it's a rare exception for projects with large % of token supply controlled by whales. i think it's not a coincidence that sun was [giving advice](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/01/22/justin-sun-claims-he-can-take-ethereum-to-10000/) to eth foundation on how to keep the price up. and still, it does not guarantee that the whales won't dump their bags if adoption explodes and demand suddenly goes up. they might make sure the graph in btc stays consistent, and still sell the excess of supply - so retail investors still won't make more money than they could in btc.

please share your thoughts in comments, and feel free to recommend projects with good tokenomics and small % controlled by whales.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lydsai/why_altcoins_underperform_btc_imagine_permanent/,11,30,1lydsai,reddit,CryptoMarkets

 ""we’ll have to come to consensus on these half a dozen things simultaneously, which is pretty much unprecedented. given the slowing and the increasing difficulty and consensus changes to the bitcoin protocol, this is why i started talking about it a year ago.""

and hence i've raised many of lopp's same points. 

it serves both btc and qanx to do so. certainly it highlights qanx was correct to include quantum resistance on its vision for enterprise blockchain. 

but it's also important for several reasons that bitcoin addresses this. tackling the issue head on prevents panic and removes this from being a ""fud"" topic.  keeping bitcoin strong helps the entire space.

 quantum computing news will continue to make headlines as it is a worldwide race. every approach is being developed, with multiple innovations
