2025-08-07 12:47:34,"validate my btc strat morning bitcoiners,

i was late to the game in 2023, and even then only bought a small amount. about a month ago found my ledger nano and found a few thousand dollars in there. between then and now have read up again and once the republicans passed the bill that increased the debt ceiling another 5 trillion and cut taxes on the rich i knew usd was fucked (also know all the stats about money printing, never stops).

i recently quit contributing 10% to my 401k, reduced it down to get full company match. i quit contributing to my ira also (this one i’d like advice on). i now have a dca strategy of $92/day which will give me roughly $33k/year in contributions to btc.

i get quarterly bonuses from my job (around $5k net) and i’m wondering what i should do with these lump sums of cash. when i don’t know what to do i at least park it in a high yield savings account. i obviously want my cost average to be as low as possible to just shoving in lump sums at high prices given btcs volatility seems like a novice move. maybe just increase dca amount? 

does anyone still do iras? i would do roth back door since i am phased out of normal roth contribution limits.

don’t want to be an idiot on tax free gains and compounding interest. switching to an hsa as well to get that triple tax benefit as well. i just want to be as smart as possible. i used to think diversification was the best tool, but diversify in fiat just makes me feel like i’m swimming upstream against my own conviction.

p.s. thanks to this forum i found out that ledger is a piece of shit and i have already ordered a coldcard q. love this community for always looking out for each other, providing great information, and the occasional dogging because the shit is hilarious.

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ⚡",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9949,117463.47451085236

the london-listed technology firm acquired 50 bitcoin at an average price of £86,650 per coin, representing a total investment of £4,332,507.

this latest purchase brings the company’s total bitcoin holdings to an impressive 2,100 coins. the total investment now stands at £171,091,407 with an average purchase price of £81,472 per bitcoin.

the company maintains approximately £19.5 million in net cash reserves available for future bitcoin acquisitions. this substantial war chest positions them to continue their aggressive cryptocurrency accumulation strategy – the main factor in the explosion in the firm’s share price since ipo.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

i got an idea to have some sort of insurance in the case i lose my coins, while still doing self custody. in the spirit of lose your keys, not your coins, i am thinking of building this service where all your utxos in your wallet have a special script that has a spending tree where there is a fallback where my service can trigger a transfer, which activates a dead man switch where the wallet holder can cancel the spending tree during 1 month time to assure some level of trust. 

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

2025-08-08 14:43:13,"are long winded shitposts around the origins of bitcoin permitted? i'll redefine the term ""source code"" here to mean something entirely different than what it actually means. read drunk. whiskey, prefferably.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

what i need is freedom where i can just do whatever i want when i wake up, bitcoin is the way dont lose your way!

now i just stacking sats, and always feel i need to buy more lol and make my life better basically, gym and all. no more fomo no more keeping up with the joneses, no more flexing for random strangers which very2 retarded lmao.

you see some people haven't escaped the car paradox, when they want fancy things, they really don't want the fancy things, it's the imagination after they after, you feel you got much respect from having expensive bikes or cars when you ride around your city or else, but really if you want respect or admiration, just be kind, has nothing to do with money really,

stay humble, stack sats, focus on your (my) life, live on your own terms. bitcoin helps me to ingore all the noises this world offers, including social media and stuff. be nobody, its peaceful, yeah i like that tho, be nobody and own bitcoin, nothing cooler than that lol

2025-08-09 04:10:21,"softwar: this book about bitcoin blew me away i recommended this book when i only started it to few crypto friends and now that i finished it (and i’m completely blow away by it’s potential
implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

i’m wondering what the bitcoin community thinks about this. is the current plan — relying on transaction fees alone — the best long-term approach for security, or do you see potential challenges?

for perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth

a quadrillion?

that’s crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

ridiculous.

i have been investing since the beginning of 2024, the same amount in dollars every week. so far, i have only increased the amount i invest once.

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.

i’ve also been paying attention to warren’s comments about debt to gdp…specifically:   buffett described the current us fiscal deficit as “unsustainable over a very long period of time” and warned that “it has the aspect to it that gets uncontrollable at a certain point.”

that said, with the rise of ai in every aspect of every business, gdp will likely rise significantly.

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today’s 118k price is scary high, especially if you’re used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don’t look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn’t find one, unless you look back in history… lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it’s relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i’m on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc…) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850’s) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc — thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven’t heard from ai) hey all — long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i’m coming from and what i’m considering. i’ve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
• i contributed to my school district’s 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory — terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn’t appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
• i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there’s a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1–2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
• separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that’s being paid down aggressively.
• now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i’m seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i’d put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
• i’ve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don’t gamble, pay down debt, don’t lever into volatile assets. i get that. i’m asking this community for perspectives i haven’t considered — practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
• i believe in bitcoin’s long-term thesis — adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it’s likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
• i really don’t want to liquidate my existing btc position — emotionally and strategically i’d rather hold. that’s why i’m considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
• i’m disciplined on repayment timelines and i’m comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i’m trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you’d known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i’m considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this — how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says “don’t gamble.” i’m looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i’m curious about: partial loan → partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced — stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who’s been through a leveraged crypto move — how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
• i’m not asking whether crypto is risky — i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
• i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i’m trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
• i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you’re going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn’t, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i’ve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i’ll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i’ll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why — so others can learn from the outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mmvy3t/been_burned_by_my_403b_borrowed_to_buy_btc/,6,22,1mmvy3t,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9345,119266.92516880557

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the “talking points” for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: “bitcoin has no intrinsic value”. “bitcoins value is unreliable and subjective”. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, “*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop­erties that are valued by acting men.”*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of “intrinsic value”

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing. 

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.”[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok. 

the words ""intrinsic"" and “value” existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, “the philosophical definition is wrong and it’s not what intrinsic value means” is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

10. [bitcoin myths](https://www.athena-alpha.com/bitcoin-myths/)

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has “intrinsic value”. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion. 

1. “subject” - any being or living thing.
2. “value judgement” - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim) 
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.) 
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently — just that we’ve never seen it happen.) 
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects. 
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects. 
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

i'm a relative newb to btc and have been buying small amounts of bitcoin on the etoro app over the past few years, just because that was where i had other stocks. i'm now reading about how etoro isn't ideal for holding crypto and that you don't actually own it, can't transfer it easily etc. and so i'd like to transfer the amount to coinbase, which seems good for beginners. what is the easiest way to transfer this? should i just close the trades and use the money to buy on coinbase? my plan is to buy regularly (around 10% of my savings) and hold. so any advise on that would be appreciated, thank!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mn6qiy/moving_bitcoin_from_etoro_to_coinbase/,0,7,1mn6qiy,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.8784,

2025-08-12 00:46:59,"beyond dca: i've hit my 6-month emergency fund goal. time to get more aggressive with bitcoin? hey everyone, i've hit a bit of a crossroads with my investment strategy and would love to get your perspective.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.841,118773.79960860992

someone actually commented on the video saying ""its not ok"", and how they ""dont know what the solution is"" (to which i obviously replied with a one word answer), but since developing my interest in bitcoin just 18 months ago, it has become so much more obvious how gradual degradation of fiat, general complacency and a system i suspect intentionally designed to keep people working has resulted in such an abysmal situation that is only getting worse.

not because i wanted to “beat the market”, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton — not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to “set and forget,” but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper… but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i’m sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

if anyone’s interested, i can dive deeper into:

* how multiplier dca actually works in practice
* the mistakes i made early that almost killed the project
* why i think 90% of dca bots on the market are using sub-optimal execution logic

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let’s suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don’t want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france’s reputation for *la révolution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i’m only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,0,2,1moaozn,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9432,

i’ve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you’re curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it’s a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i’ve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:

isn't it technically possible for the exchange to memorize the btc adress of the non-custodial wallet you send for example 10000 sats to? so that when you send it back to the exchange, it can identify and verify that those 10000 sats are exactly the sats that you bought there for a certain price.

2025-08-13 14:10:14,"btc’s bullish momentum might be far from over bitcoin has been on a tear lately, smashing through resistance levels and holding its ground like it owns the market. what’s interesting is this rally doesn’t feel like the quick, overheated pumps we’ve seen before, it feels more controlled, backed by strong market participation and real buying pressure.

zooming out, we’re still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn’t yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you’ve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

it actually looks like btc isn’t just strong here… it’s just getting started. if momentum continues and key resistance zones flip to support, we could be looking at levels people thought were months away.

2025-08-13 17:40:10,"bag the real prize *by leibish polnauer & diana jarrett*

  
sotheby’s fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at us $23 million for instance, one never says ‘used’ referring to such items. they are always preowned.

 the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40 year old handbag. obviously it’s been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is singularly unique. created by hermès for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still  it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point, suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic hermès style.

 how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, “jewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.”

# diamonds are a single harvest 

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that’s it.

# bitcoin benefits

i grew up catholic, and even though i am not religious now, the “spread the gospel” mindset stayed with me.

i understand enough economics to believe inflation and currency debasement are long-term risks, and i feel a responsibility to warn people.

i live in a high cost area making $30/hr. most of my friends earn similar or less.

i believe bitcoin will capture excess liquidity over time, and that waiting could be costly.

my urgency is not always matched by their readiness. what i see as a lifeboat can feel to them like i am telling them their ship is sinking. this mismatch has made me push too hard at times.

not “like” electricity… but behaving *as* electricity in an engineering sense:

* **btc = electrons** — the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** — the push that drives the current.
* **miners = generators** — converting real-world energy into unforgeable monetary signal.
* **financial instruments (like mstr’s capital stack) = circuit components** — switches, resistors, capacitors, magnetic fields… each shaping or routing the bitcoin current in a unique way.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it’s not a stock, not a company — it’s the base layer of a new monetary grid.

i put together a full write-up here with diagrams:

(nasdaq: pfsa)**, a trailblazing digital health company revolutionizing continuous biochemistry monitoring, **has taken a bold step toward enhancing shareholder value with a strategic $100 million equity line of credit (eloc) from ascent partners fund llc**. announced on july 21, 2025, this innovative move positions profusa as a forward-thinking adopter of bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, aligning the company with a digital-first financial future.

the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin. **this strategy not only strengthens profusa’s balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company’s prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa’s commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.** this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa’s leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa’s bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time.

this sparrow wallet connects to my node to see and send transactions. it’s a 2-of-3 multisig with three physical hardware wallets.
each seed is engraved on a metal plate, with each one stored in a different location, extremely well hidden. a family member knows the location of one, my wife knows another, and my son knows the last one (and i know all three). they’re fully aware of the absolute necessity of never mentioning them to anyone under any circumstances, and a detailed procedure explaining how to recover the funds will be sent to them upon my death.

to maximize privacy, i have another single-sig hardware wallet that serves as a hot wallet. that’s the one that receives btc purchases from exchanges, and from there i send the funds on-chain to my true cold wallet, using a different public key each time.

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions—like fear and greed—that those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,5,22,1mrjzn5,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9955,

2025-08-16 04:53:37,"bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction this essay compares and contrasts different authors from the mises institute alignment to an inquiry into mises own writing in regard to the concept known as mises regression theorem.  it re-visits a question that satoshi responded to about the nature of bitcoin and the possibilities of originations of the moneyness of considered objects:  
  
""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises’ axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn’t declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo’s work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,10,40,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176,

it’s not just about price action (though watching btc grind back toward new levels is exciting on its own). it’s the way the community around it has matured. you don’t see the same level of blind hype like in 2017 or even 2021. instead, i notice more people talking about *why* they’re holding, how they’re using it, and what role bitcoin actually plays in their long-term plans.

for me, i’ve been stacking slowly, nothing crazy, just consistent dca. what surprises me most is how many of the people i talk to, friends, colleagues, even family, are starting to take bitcoin seriously. not as a quick trade, but as something with actual staying power.

i’m curious though… how’s everyone here approaching btc right now?

* are you stacking aggressively while it’s still “cheap”?
* just holding what you’ve got and waiting it out?
* or are you in the camp that thinks the best entry was years ago and the upside is mostly gone?

2025-08-18 08:38:25,"why i still believe in bitcoin despite all the noise every week there’s some new headline, altcoins pumping, memecoins crashing, regulations tightening, etfs buying, miners selling. it’s easy to get distracted in the noise.

but whenever i zoom out, i always end up back at the same place: **bitcoin**. it’s not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. yet, it’s the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every “bitcoin is dead” article.

what keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. a decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. i can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone’s permission. in times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

of course, the price volatility can be wild. i’ve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. for me, it’s less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

curious to hear from the community, what keeps *you* holding bitcoin after all these years? is it the philosophy, the profits, or just pure belief in where it’s headed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mtgexd/why_i_still_believe_in_bitcoin_despite_all_the/,6,31,1mtgexd,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.966,

a few days ago, almost 12 months after being locked out of her account i managed to get her access to the bitcoin and everything sorted.

if i had a chance to go deeper i would ask a person what work is. and explain how humanity literally expends their life force to get money. nothing is more valuable than a persons life. therefore when a government prints money they are committing an unpardonable sin. devaluing the life force of humanity.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the “ wen lambo” crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

2025-08-19 05:33:10,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we’ve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

the plan is to offer more stock to get around $14b more in eth, all relatively soon, so wouldn't the price of bmnr be almost guaranteed to half from the $50 level or even more as it adds in more and more shares as long as eth stays anywhere around the $4k-5k level? 

why would anyone buy at these levels then? is that why we saw massive volume around the $60-70 levels, it was people getting out until bmnr is done diluting its shares and then they'll get back in? seems like if you bought anywhere from $50-70 that you're needing eth to get to $6k+ to start breaking even, especially if you got it around $70, might even need eth at $8-9k by the time it's all said and done with the dilution. 

seems like it would be better to just wait until bmnr is at $25 before buying and then just selling again next time they announce a big share offering, rinse and repeat. 

do i just have a complete misunderstanding of all this? i do see where mstr 10x'd to \~$500 when btc went from $40k to $85k, but since then, that's just been the top for mstr with all the share offerings, despite btc gaining another 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mumty6/bmnr_question/,0,1,1mumty6,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.8664,

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

· for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
· for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

2025-08-19 17:25:28,"1971 broke money 1971 — nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 — us debt explodes  
1971 — wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 — dollar = debt  
1971 — petrodollar born  
1971 — families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 — women pushed to work (“liberation”)

1971 didn’t change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it’s $34 trillion.

that’s not growth. that’s theft—paid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year… for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education—everything essential—started outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of “liberation.” but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me…

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 — federal reserve created  
1913 — income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed’s scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn’t lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don’t serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn’t just blood + bombs. it’s debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq… all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that’s how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
🔹 us national debt → $400b → $34t+  
🔹 inflation steals \~97% of the dollar’s value  
🔹 wealth gap explodes  
🔹 the “american dream” dies for most families  
🔹 dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don’t hold cash. they hold assets—real estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you’re told to “save” while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can’t be repaid and the system collapses.

that’s why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today’s chaos…  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

but they would sell to capture these massive gains - pulling wealth out of our community to hold dirty fiat. 

these brutal corrections are a gift to the hodlers. they transfer wealth from the traders to the hodlers. if the speculators win, wealth is transferred from hodlers to the traders. a true hodler shouldn't mind the volatility. if the price goes up too much at once, it encourages selling. we want slow and steady gains with regular corrections.

which is better central banking or bitcoin? 

philosophical question here(i'm a long term holder of bitcoin but still ponder on these). 

if the u.s. or another country pegged its dollar to bitcoin, the economy would likely face massive >problems because bitcoin has a fixed supply. as the economy grows, money wouldn’t grow with it, causing prices to fall (deflation). that sounds good at first, but it makes people hoard money instead of spending or investing, and it makes debts harder to pay back. the government and federal reserve would also lose tools like lowering interest rates or creating more money to fight recessions. overall, it would make the economy rigid and unstable—similar to the old gold standard, but even stricter—slowing growth and making crises worse.
bitcoin would ultimately ruin our modern economy, through deflation.  something worse than inflation.

2025-08-20 08:40:16,"eth evolution: from pow to pos – what’s next? ethereum has come a long way since its inception in 2015. initially, it was just a decentralized platform for smart contracts, but now eth has become one of the most popular blockchain networks in the crypto world. however, its journey has not been easy, and the evolution of ethereum is a story of constant adaptation.

🚀 early days: proof of work and scalability issues

when ethereum was launched, it used the proof of work consensus mechanism, similar to bitcoin. this helped secure the network, but it also led to significant scalability issues. ethereum was slow and expensive to use, especially during periods of high demand. gas fees became a serious barrier for small investors and developers.

🔥 transition to proof of stake: ethereum 2.0

to solve these problems, ethereum moved to the proof of stake mechanism with the ethereum 2.0 upgrade. the transition from pow to pos was a major step, improving not only energy efficiency but also scalability and security. the merge in 2022 became a key moment, and now ethereum has become much more stable.

now, staking has replaced mining, and eth holders can lock their coins to secure the network and earn rewards. this significantly reduces energy consumption and speeds up transactions.

📉 eth’s price journey: from $0.42 to $4,891.70 **🚀**

the price history of ethereum is impressive:

* **all-time low**: $0.42 (october 21, 2015)
* **all-time high**: $4,891.70 (november 16, 2021)
* growth: ethereum showed an incredible growth of +997,492.63% from its historical low to its historical high.

this dramatic price jump demonstrates ethereum’s potential as a leading blockchain platform but also highlights market volatility.

when talking about the evolution of ethereum, different types of evolutions come to mind, such as technological evolution, social evolution, economic evolution, environmental evolution, cultural evolution, and the crypto evolution activity by whitebit × tether × tradingview. these are all evolutions that have become part of the formation of everything we have today.

💬 what do you think?

ethereum has changed significantly since its launch, but with ongoing updates and the growing web3 ecosystem, where do you see ethereum in the next few years? will it maintain its position as the leader among smart contract platforms, or will competitors like **sol** or **ada** surpass it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mv98xh/eth_evolution_from_pow_to_pos_whats_next/,0,4,1mv98xh,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9875,113764.0466941384

these are some of mine: 

- it challenges existing power structures (like banks, governments, elites).
- bitcoin promotes financial inclusion and power equality for people without access to the banking system. 
- can be a tool for activists and people living under oppressive regimes.
