2025-08-19 17:40:48+00:00,"have you learned to love the corrections yet? if bitcoin were to shoot upwards without correction during the bull markets, then the degens (leveraged speculative traders) would capture massive gains in bitcoin with their leveraged longs. 

but they would sell to capture these massive gains - pulling wealth out of our community to hold dirty fiat. 

these brutal corrections are a gift to the hodlers. they transfer wealth from the traders to the hodlers. if the speculators win, wealth is transferred from hodlers to the traders. a true hodler shouldn't mind the volatility. if the price goes up too much at once, it encourages selling. we want slow and steady gains with regular corrections. 

corrections are healthy.

love the volatility.

2025-08-19 17:25:28+00:00,"1971 broke money 1971 ‚Äî nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 ‚Äî us debt explodes  
1971 ‚Äî wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 ‚Äî dollar = debt  
1971 ‚Äî petrodollar born  
1971 ‚Äî families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 ‚Äî women pushed to work (‚Äúliberation‚Äù)

1971 didn‚Äôt change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it‚Äôs $34 trillion.

that‚Äôs not growth. that‚Äôs theft‚Äîpaid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year‚Ä¶ for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education‚Äîeverything essential‚Äîstarted outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me‚Ä¶

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 ‚Äî federal reserve created  
1913 ‚Äî income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed‚Äôs scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn‚Äôt lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don‚Äôt serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn‚Äôt just blood + bombs. it‚Äôs debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq‚Ä¶ all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that‚Äôs how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
üîπ us national debt ‚Üí $400b ‚Üí $34t+  
üîπ inflation steals \~97% of the dollar‚Äôs value  
üîπ wealth gap explodes  
üîπ the ‚Äúamerican dream‚Äù dies for most families  
üîπ dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don‚Äôt hold cash. they hold assets‚Äîreal estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsave‚Äù while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can‚Äôt be repaid and the system collapses.

that‚Äôs why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today‚Äôs chaos‚Ä¶  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

2025-08-19 17:13:48+00:00,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

¬∑ for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
¬∑ for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,4,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9455

2025-08-19 05:33:10+00:00,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we‚Äôve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca.

if i had a chance to go deeper i would ask a person what work is. and explain how humanity literally expends their life force to get money. nothing is more valuable than a persons life. therefore when a government prints money they are committing an unpardonable sin. devaluing the life force of humanity.

the plan is to offer more stock to get around $14b more in eth, all relatively soon, so wouldn't the price of bmnr be almost guaranteed to half from the $50 level or even more as it adds in more and more shares as long as eth stays anywhere around the $4k-5k level? 

why would anyone buy at these levels then? is that why we saw massive volume around the $60-70 levels, it was people getting out until bmnr is done diluting its shares and then they'll get back in? seems like if you bought anywhere from $50-70 that you're needing eth to get to $6k+ to start breaking even, especially if you got it around $70, might even need eth at $8-9k by the time it's all said and done with the dilution. 

seems like it would be better to just wait until bmnr is at $25 before buying and then just selling again next time they announce a big share offering, rinse and repeat. 

do i just have a complete misunderstanding of all this? i do see where mstr 10x'd to \~$500 when btc went from $40k to $85k, but since then, that's just been the top for mstr with all the share offerings, despite btc gaining another 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mumty6/bmnr_question/,0,0,1mumty6,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.8664

not being able to make the money with a minimum wage teen job as well as stay in school, i resorted to selling fake ids. i found a chinese website on the dark web that allowed you to input everything you wanted on each id, choose the state, and ship the id directly to your customer (most being 18-20 year old college kids).

the website only took payment in bitcoin, which at the time wasn‚Äôt a household name. it was the first time i had heard of bitcoin so i assumed it was just some kind of currency they used in china. i would physically walk to a bitcoin atm at a deli 30 minutes away and turn cash into bitcoin and then proceed with the payments and orders.

for years, the task of future-proofing bitcoin was handled not by engineers, but by ideologues. the quantum threat was a known variable‚Äîa computational cascade that could invalidate the network's core security assumptions. yet, consensus on a defense mechanism was nonexistent.

factions formed around specific post-quantum algorithms: falcon, dilithium, sphincs+. the debate was not a technical collaboration but a series of zero-sum conflicts waged on mailing lists and forums. they termed this ""decentralization."" in practice, it was systemic paralysis. while these factions debated protocol minutiae, china was operationalizing the threat, assembling the quantum architecture that would make the entire argument irrelevant

and then the variable became a certainty. the news broke on the bbc at 9 am, london. the anchor wasn't reporting on a kinetic conflict or a market anomaly, but on a keynote from a cryptography conference. the footage was dry, academic. the content, however, was a terminal diagnosis for public-key cryptography:

>

that was the event. a single slide that nullified the security of six million bitcoins. the market reaction was not a panic; it was a liquidation event, proceeding with the cold speed of an algorithm.

the point of failure was not mathematical; it was social. while china developed a strategic capability, the bitcoin community optimized for ideological purity. burn versus steal. act now versus wait. decentralization, in its implemented form, had become a recursive loop of inaction. each faction reinforced its position until the possibility of a coordinated response was zero.

even michael saylor, the network's most vocal proponent, recalibrated his rhetoric from prophecy to damage control. in a clipped, emergency interview, his tone was stripped of its characteristic energy.

>*""i can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre here,"" saylor said, shaking his head slowly. ""after all these years, this is it. the cryptographic foundations that held digital value together have been broken, and there‚Äôs no going back. but discussing or debate on what‚Äôs lost won‚Äôt help us. we have to accept that this state is terminal, and the only way forward is to rebuild‚Äîfast, smarter, with quantum-resistant technology. the old debates, the endless disagreements‚Äîthey‚Äôre a luxury we no longer have. it‚Äôs time to execute.""*

it was a predictable outcome, a known vulnerability that was discussed, modeled, and ultimately ignored until it manifested. the final analysis was brutal in its simplicity:¬†*‚Äúsystem integrity was compromised due to a failure to implement known solutions in a timely manner. for 15 years, resources were allocated to internal disputes over minor variables while a critical, system-level vulnerability was left unpatched.‚Äù*¬†in less formal terms: they had been warned.

well now then what is bitcoin? bitcoin has no utility it has an idea behind it. so what it is? it‚Äôs a pure belief asset (pba) in which a community of people fell in love with its inspiring narrative (which the og bag workers of bitcoin built out) the goal: to disrupt traditional finance, first appearing post 2008 financial crisis as a peer to peer transactional intermediary meant to cut out wall street

the only reason it holds value is due to fact that people believe it does and this all steams from the underlying community. without og delusional bag workers its doesn‚Äôt exist today. you can pretend that it was simply the tech behind it and that it was inevitable but without the og delusion bulls who built out that narrative that you think you now understand it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt exist

so when bidding coins you want to look for organic fairly distributed projects that‚Äôs are community based. if you must bid utilities coins look for those that have good enough tech and narrative for a legitimate community to form ($eth)

if youve read this far i beg you to check out #spx6900 like just look into it

this is the next iteration of a pure belief asset with a similar narrative of rebellion to bitcoin

in a time when more and more average americans are getting priced out of their local restaurants people are going to look towards alternative investments/ revolution 

many people are slowly subscribing to the idea that the system is broken so let‚Äôs tear it down, seen with the growing popularity of socialist u.s representatives across the country

the answer isn‚Äôt pro socialist policy it‚Äôs getting involved into the pure side of capitalism: activism 

i am literally trying to help you.
