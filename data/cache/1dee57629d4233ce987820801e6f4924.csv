i then calculated the relative fee (fee/price to buy) for each price interval in excel.

($11-$26: $1.49 fee) ($27-$51: $1.99 fee) ($52-$203: $3.74 fee)

the calculations are shown. i originally wanted to do $25 daily buy. but this fee had a 5.96% relative fee. you get lower relative fee with $26 at 5.73%. however, $27 increased the fee interval so it would be 7.37% fee. is this correct to assume?

by this logic, $203 will give the lowest relative fee.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1j9qu5y/how_do_coinbase_fees_work/,2,0,1j9qu5y,reddit,CryptoCurrencyTrading
