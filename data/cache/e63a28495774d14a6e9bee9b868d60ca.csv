bitcoin dominance slipping & altcoins like eth, sol, and xrp are gaining traction. the altcoin season index is nearing 50, suggesting early signs of rotation, but still below the 75 mark that signals a full altseason. traders are split: some see rising interest in altcoin futures and shifting capital as bullish signals, while others remain cautious due to low volume.

2025-07-30 20:21:13+00:00,"fed holds rates as expected but crypto markets already pricing in the boring outcome, here's what happens next so the fomc meeting wrapped up with exactly what everyone expected rates staying at current levels. no surprise cuts, no hawkish surprises, just powell doing his usual ""we're data dependent"" routine. but the crypto reaction (or lack thereof) tells us way more about where we're headed.

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,60,13,1mdhcve,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-30 20:00:06+00:00,"how can there be an altseason if people are excepting one? i don't remember the term altseason coming into use until after spring 2018. maybe it was used before that but i don't remember it (i have been in since 2013).

in very early 2017 no one was expecting a massive alt rally. it happened because some people thought btc would be replaced with currency coins and there would be use for other more fancy projects. alts did rally in previous years to but not like 2017. the point being people were not expecting it at soon at btc best its 2013 high. altseason was a complete surprise.

in late 2020 alts got hammered (except eth) and btc rallied. people were selling alts into btc even when btc was well past its 2017 high. altseason came in january 2021 and many were surprised at the sudden move and came to the acceptance that we had altseason a few weeks into it. 

so today when we have btc or eth rallying many people proclaim altseason. 

maybe we need complete capitulation of alts before altseason?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdgtc0/how_can_there_be_an_altseason_if_people_are/,0,32,1mdgtc0,reddit,CryptoMarkets
