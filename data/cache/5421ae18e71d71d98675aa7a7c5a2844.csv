2025-08-19 17:25:28+00:00,"1971 broke money 1971 ‚Äî nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 ‚Äî us debt explodes  
1971 ‚Äî wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 ‚Äî dollar = debt  
1971 ‚Äî petrodollar born  
1971 ‚Äî families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 ‚Äî women pushed to work (‚Äúliberation‚Äù)

1971 didn‚Äôt change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it‚Äôs $34 trillion.

that‚Äôs not growth. that‚Äôs theft‚Äîpaid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year‚Ä¶ for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education‚Äîeverything essential‚Äîstarted outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me‚Ä¶

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 ‚Äî federal reserve created  
1913 ‚Äî income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed‚Äôs scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn‚Äôt lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don‚Äôt serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn‚Äôt just blood + bombs. it‚Äôs debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq‚Ä¶ all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that‚Äôs how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
üîπ us national debt ‚Üí $400b ‚Üí $34t+  
üîπ inflation steals \~97% of the dollar‚Äôs value  
üîπ wealth gap explodes  
üîπ the ‚Äúamerican dream‚Äù dies for most families  
üîπ dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don‚Äôt hold cash. they hold assets‚Äîreal estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsave‚Äù while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can‚Äôt be repaid and the system collapses.

that‚Äôs why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today‚Äôs chaos‚Ä¶  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

2025-08-19 17:13:48+00:00,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

¬∑ for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
¬∑ for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,5,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9455

2025-08-19 05:33:10+00:00,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we‚Äôve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions.

people look at bitcoin as some mysterious voodoo magic. sure lots of people have heard about some old lost cousin that made a bag buying the funny computer coins, but you'd get laughed at for implying bitcoin is anything other than just that.

people here hold their life savings in their bank accounts and dont even consider the effects inflation has. risk tolerance is extremely low.

from my point of view, direct adoption of bitcoin is impossible here. i genuinely don't see any future for it.

the important point here is this:

he already bought,  and tat means that he won't be buying more for a while. that means he won't be supporting the price anymore (until a few weeks later).

so this is a signal for automated bots, short term traders and speculators, to dump on this partial top, since it's a very safe bet the price won't be as supported in the coming days or weeks.

also, they know that probably will cause a cascade o liquidation of leveraged longs. 

so when mr. saylor puts out that tweet it's the best time to dump and short bitcoin.

i'm a bitcoin bull an maxi. and this info is so you can buy cheap right now.

so this is not the time to sell. this is the time you buy the dip.

in the previous essay ([bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‚Äêsolution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1mrl65c/bitcoin_most_certainly_violates_mises_regression/)) we ended with statements by mises that his (austrian) school of thought ""praxeology"" rejects empirical (think archeological) based arguments and only accepts arguments extended from reason. 

here we will show countless examples of saifedean ammous, a purported austrian economics professor relying on empirical based points and arguments trying to make his conclusion about the economic implications of bitcoin. 

in this essay i use the perspective and intention of szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with mises regression theorem, to highlight saifedean ammous‚Äô nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including mises, hayek, and nash as well as implicitly szabo and satoshi.  
  
further i highlight that saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to jo walton, ‚Äúthe analogy between bitcoin and yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.‚Äú  
  
this essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‚Äòun-wrapped‚Äô using szabonian deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as and money-like things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).

anyway, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how many people keep their bitcoin on exchanges and i'm on about considerable amounts because i know some of you will say ""no point self custodying if you only have ¬£25 and a dream"", but lets be honest if you think that kind of bag is your key to an early retirement then please, treat yourself to a cold wallet and maybe a tattoo on your forehead that reads ""tell me to buy more bitcoin"". on a serious note, how many of you actually read the t&c's when signing up to an exchange? i didn't, but there will also be things that say:

""we reserve the right to suspend withdrawals""

""insolvency may result in partial or total loss of funds""

""in the event of catastrophic failure, we'll send you an automated email with the word ""unfortunately"" and picture of us sipping cocktails funded by everyone who lost their money""

we all know things like this has happened before which is why i'm hoping to at least give one person a sign to finally getting around to ordering that hardware wallet. i also find it a lot easier to hold on to my sats as its a whole ""thing"" to actually get around to liquidating. i do definitely sleep better knowing i'm the only person who has access to my funds and in that worst case scenario, global meltdown, we only need one bitcoiner to keep his node running and we can send some to the local prepper who is selling beans out of his garage.

so if you've got a hardware wallet sat in your shopping basket (the manufactures website of course) then see this as your sign to buy it, just make sure your keys are somewhere secure because its very easy to go half arsed with it at first but when your bag grows and your security doesnt, you're playing with fire.

i hate to sound old but just be sensible and maybe have a redbull just before unboxing ;).

""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""

thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo‚Äôs work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,9,40,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176

2025-08-16 03:54:53+00:00,"basic questions from a bitcoin newbie hey everyone,

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions‚Äîlike fear and greed‚Äîthat those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,3,22,1mrjzn5,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9955

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

i am not jealous. i am not poor. i could own several whole bitcoins. i have no regrets. i do not hate. bitcoin does not need to fail for me to succeed. i do not personally see the value. i do not see it as a solution. i do not see the past gains continuing in the future. i will be impressed if bitcoin survives the upcoming capital rotation event but i will still not own it. i think ""you will own nothing and be happy"" is a direct reference to bitcoin. i like to own real, tangible things. i don't even like fake tits. 

many here are desperate or have a chip on their shoulder. they want to be proven right when others doubted them. they want to tell their boss to f off. they want the easy path to wealth. a lottery ticket. they want to be a part of something on the ground floor that separates them from the others. they want to feel smart.  they hear the bitcoin pizza story and think it will happen again. this includes michael saylor who i feel is reckless at best. this is my view. past performance may not equal future performance.

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa‚Äôs commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.**¬†this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa‚Äôs leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa‚Äôs bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

sotheby‚Äôs fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag¬†dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at¬†us $23 million for instance, one never says ‚Äòused‚Äô referring to such items. they are¬†always preowned.

¬†the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar¬†hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40¬†year old handbag. obviously it‚Äôs been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is¬†singularly unique. created by herm√®s for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it¬†possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still¬† it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point,¬†suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic herm√®s style.

¬†how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, ‚Äújewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.‚Äù

# diamonds are a single harvest¬†

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that‚Äôs it.

zooming out, we‚Äôre still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn‚Äôt yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you‚Äôve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

i‚Äôve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you‚Äôre curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it‚Äôs a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i‚Äôve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:

2025-08-12 14:45:33+00:00,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let‚Äôs suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don‚Äôt want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france‚Äôs reputation for *la r√©volution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i‚Äôm only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,0,2,1moaozn,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9432

not because i wanted to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton ‚Äî not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to ‚Äúset and forget,‚Äù but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper‚Ä¶ but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i‚Äôm sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

2025-08-12 00:46:59+00:00,"beyond dca: i've hit my 6-month emergency fund goal. time to get more aggressive with bitcoin? hey everyone, i've hit a bit of a crossroads with my investment strategy and would love to get your perspective.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,17,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.841

passkey:

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

2025-08-11 00:57:18+00:00,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the ‚Äútalking points‚Äù for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: ‚Äúbitcoin has no intrinsic value‚Äù. ‚Äúbitcoins value is unreliable and subjective‚Äù. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, ‚Äú*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop¬≠erties that are valued by acting men.‚Äù*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing.¬†

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.‚Äù[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok.¬†

the words ""intrinsic"" and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, ‚Äúthe philosophical definition is wrong and it‚Äôs not what intrinsic value means‚Äù is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion.¬†

1. ‚Äúsubject‚Äù - any being or living thing.
2. ‚Äúvalue judgement‚Äù - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim)¬†
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.)¬†
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently ‚Äî just that we‚Äôve never seen it happen.)¬†
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects.¬†
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects.¬†
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

2025-08-10 22:21:02+00:00,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc ‚Äî thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven‚Äôt heard from ai) hey all ‚Äî long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i‚Äôm coming from and what i‚Äôm considering. i‚Äôve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
‚Ä¢ i contributed to my school district‚Äôs 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory ‚Äî terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn‚Äôt appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
‚Ä¢ i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there‚Äôs a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1‚Äì2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
‚Ä¢ separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that‚Äôs being paid down aggressively.
‚Ä¢ now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i‚Äôm seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i‚Äôd put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don‚Äôt gamble, pay down debt, don‚Äôt lever into volatile assets. i get that. i‚Äôm asking this community for perspectives i haven‚Äôt considered ‚Äî practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
‚Ä¢ i believe in bitcoin‚Äôs long-term thesis ‚Äî adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it‚Äôs likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
‚Ä¢ i really don‚Äôt want to liquidate my existing btc position ‚Äî emotionally and strategically i‚Äôd rather hold. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm disciplined on repayment timelines and i‚Äôm comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i‚Äôm trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you‚Äôd known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i‚Äôm considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this ‚Äî how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt gamble.‚Äù i‚Äôm looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i‚Äôm curious about: partial loan ‚Üí partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced ‚Äî stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who‚Äôs been through a leveraged crypto move ‚Äî how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm not asking whether crypto is risky ‚Äî i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
‚Ä¢ i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i‚Äôm trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
‚Ä¢ i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you‚Äôre going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn‚Äôt, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i‚Äôve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i‚Äôll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i‚Äôll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why ‚Äî so others can learn from the outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mmvy3t/been_burned_by_my_403b_borrowed_to_buy_btc/,6,22,1mmvy3t,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9345

2025-08-10 21:32:07+00:00,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today‚Äôs 118k price is scary high, especially if you‚Äôre used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don‚Äôt look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn‚Äôt find one, unless you look back in history‚Ä¶ lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it‚Äôs relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i‚Äôm on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc‚Ä¶) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850‚Äôs) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

key features

* enter current btc balance, dca amount, and frequency
* calculates number of contributions needed 
* shows a progress bar toward 1 btc

feedback areas

* ui improvements (layout, colors, clarity)

2025-08-09 04:10:21+00:00,"softwar: this book about bitcoin blew me away i recommended this book when i only started it to few crypto friends and now that i finished it (and i‚Äôm completely blow away by it‚Äôs potential
implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don‚Äôt protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin‚Äôs proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin‚Äôs most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

2025-08-08 09:47:38+00:00,"word-of-mouth bitcoin social phenomenon i see a lot of posts about people damaging or losing relationships due to bitcoin conversations.  often times it seems people try to ""orange pill"" their friends and often times it doesn't work.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ‚ö°

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ‚ö°",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9949

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) ‚Äî intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i‚Äôm using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory ‚Äî i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: here's the seventh monthly report for the 2025 top ten experiment featuring¬†**btc, eth, xrp, bnb, sol, doge, usdc, ada, tron,**¬†and¬†**avax.**

**snapshots always taken on first of the month (data below reflects 1 aug snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **what's this all about?**¬†i purchased $100 of each of top 10 cryptos in jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. did the same annually in 2019 - 2025.¬†***learn more about the history and rules of the experiments***¬†***(including why in the world i would include stablecoins)***¬†***on the blog.***
* **july highlights:**¬†all green month, **eth** and **xrp** lead the way.  overall, **btc**¬†dropped from 1st place to 3rd, now trailing behind **xrp** and **tron.**  the class of 2025 has almost clawed itself back to even, but is still the worst performing of the eight top ten experiment portfolios.
* dca'ing once a year into top ten cryptos for the last 8 years has produced much better returns than if you'd done the same with the s&p 500 over the same time period (+342% vs s&p500's +71% - see below for details).

the 2025 top ten crypto index fund portfolio is¬†**btc, eth, xrp, bnb, sol, doge, usdc, ada, tron, avax.**

july highlights for the 2025 top ten portfolio:

* all green month
* **eth**¬†and¬†**xrp**¬†outperform the field in july
* seven months into 2025, six cryptos are in positive territory

# july ranking

here‚Äôs a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 top ten index fund experiment:

seven months into 2025, not much movement besides¬†**avax:**¬†it has dropped out of the top ten and inching closer to top 20 territory.

# july winners and losers

***july winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**eth**¬†(+46%)¬†achieved its highest monthly gain of 2025 followed by¬†**xrp**¬†(+37%), which logged its best month since january.

***july losers***¬†‚Äì¬†**btc‚Äôs**¬†\+8% wasn‚Äôt enough to keep it out of last place this month.

# overall update: xrp and tron leapfrog btc, portfolio at break even point, avax and doge in last place

**xrp‚Äôs**¬†solid month helped it jump from third to first place.¬†¬†**xrp**¬†now holds a commanding ytd lead (+38%) over second place¬†**tron**¬†(+27%).¬†**btc**¬†is in third place at +22%.¬† four cryptos are still underwater since january 2025, including last place¬†**avax**¬†(-40%).

the initial $100 invested in first place¬†**xrp**¬†seven months ago is worth $138 today.

ytd the 2025 top ten portfolio has almost broken even, down -0.4%.¬† the last time the 2025 top ten portfolio was in positive territory was the end of¬†[january](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)).¬†

# 2025 top ten portfolio vs. coinbase‚Äôs coin50

the first top ten crypto experiment was started on 1 january 2018 in an attempt to¬†***capture the gains of the entire market***. much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens¬†[like i do for my experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

this year‚Äôs friendly competition is between the 2025 top ten portfolio and the coinbase 50 index¬†**(coin50)**.¬†¬†**coin50**¬†tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

on 1 january 2025,¬†**coin50**¬†was valued at $450.54.¬† here‚Äôs the snapshot, seven months later:¬†

**july performances:**

* **the 2025 top ten portfolio**: +21%¬†
* **coin50**: +22%

the july monthly victory goes to:¬†**coin50**¬†(its fourth monthly victory in a row)

**overall since january 1st, 2025:**¬†

* **the 2025 top ten portfolio**:¬†-0.4%
* **coin50**: +5%

overall lead:¬† **coin50**

for the more visual, here‚Äôs the table i‚Äôm using to track the friendly top ten vs.¬†**coin50**¬†competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/hvafukh5e6kf1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f0be209e4df960191c6878213903c2974a6cbb

# combining the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 top ten crypto portfolios¬†

the 2025 top ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.¬† so, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the top ten crypto index fund experiments?

* 2018 top ten experiment: up +80% (total value $1,804)
* 2019 top ten experiment: up +847% (total value $9,474)
* 2020 top ten experiment: up +1109% (total value $12,086) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 top ten experiment: up +403% (total value $5,025)
* 2022 top ten experiment: down +2% (total value $1,019)
* 2023 top ten experiment: up +216% (total value $3,156)
* 2024 top ten experiment: up +78% (total value $1,780)
* 2025 top ten experiment: down -0.4% (total value $966) (¬†***worst performing portfolio****)*

taking the eight portfolios together:

**after a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 top ten cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$35,340.**

https://preview.redd.it/ongar9d7e6kf1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=23cddfcbf07e15147ffb60432546b8487ffa849f

**that‚Äôs up +342%**¬†on the combined portfolios. the peak for the combined top ten index fund experiment portfolios was¬†[**november 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.¬†¬†

here‚Äôs the combined monthly roi since i started tracking the metric in january 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/keutvw98e6kf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca287c079005ff1d8b676e9975493df11c1e29f

in summary:¬†***that‚Äôs a +342% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the top ten on january 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# comparison to s&p 500

i‚Äôm also tracking the s&p 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/n75xt4x9e6kf1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=780dd4423ecb606c0f528e8e307be11e66ac7c25

the s&p 500 is up +6% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on new year‚Äôs day would be worth $1,061 had it been redirected to the s&p.

taking the same invest-$1,000-on-january-1st-of-each-year approach with the s&p 500 that i‚Äôve been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2018 = $2,334 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2019 = $2,489 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2020 = $1,931 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2021 = $1,661 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2022 = $1,309 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2023 = $1,625 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2024 = $1,308 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2025 = $1,061 today

taken together, the results for a similar approach with the s&p:¬†

**after eight $1,000 annual investments on january 1st into an s&p 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,717.**

that is up¬†**+71%**¬†[since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+342%**¬†gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios.¬†¬†

the visual below shows¬†a comparison on roi between a top ten crypto approach and the s&p as per the rules of the top ten experiments:¬†¬†

2025-08-19 16:09:33+00:00,"bmnr question any idea of exactly how this eth treasury pricing actually works? as far as i can tell, at $50, the cap is at $8.5b with eth holdings worth about $6.5b. 

the plan is to offer more stock to get around $14b more in eth, all relatively soon, so wouldn't the price of bmnr be almost guaranteed to half from the $50 level or even more as it adds in more and more shares as long as eth stays anywhere around the $4k-5k level? 

why would anyone buy at these levels then? is that why we saw massive volume around the $60-70 levels, it was people getting out until bmnr is done diluting its shares and then they'll get back in? seems like if you bought anywhere from $50-70 that you're needing eth to get to $6k+ to start breaking even, especially if you got it around $70, might even need eth at $8-9k by the time it's all said and done with the dilution. 

seems like it would be better to just wait until bmnr is at $25 before buying and then just selling again next time they announce a big share offering, rinse and repeat. 

do i just have a complete misunderstanding of all this? i do see where mstr 10x'd to \~$500 when btc went from $40k to $85k, but since then, that's just been the top for mstr with all the share offerings, despite btc gaining another 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mumty6/bmnr_question/,0,1,1mumty6,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.8664

2025-08-19 00:39:45+00:00,"i had bitcoin when it was $200 and i didn‚Äôt hold any back in high school my mid-30‚Äôs single parent mom got sick with lyme disease and went from being healthy to barely being able to walk or talk within 6 months. we lived in a very high cost city and i had to figure out how to come up with about $3000/month as a 16 year old very quickly.

not being able to make the money with a minimum wage teen job as well as stay in school, i resorted to selling fake ids. i found a chinese website on the dark web that allowed you to input everything you wanted on each id, choose the state, and ship the id directly to your customer (most being 18-20 year old college kids).

the website only took payment in bitcoin, which at the time wasn‚Äôt a household name. it was the first time i had heard of bitcoin so i assumed it was just some kind of currency they used in china. i would physically walk to a bitcoin atm at a deli 30 minutes away and turn cash into bitcoin and then proceed with the payments and orders.

i did this for the last two years of high school, was able to graduate and go to college, and pay for my mom‚Äôs medical bills (including chemo). she is now almost 50 and healthy.

unfortunately, after high school i stopped with the hustle and never kept any of the bitcoin. only years later did i start to hear about it

2025-08-18 18:49:01+00:00,"time to bring back app dds to the sub - my overview of turtle **preamble**: 

as a long time user of this subreddit, i've seen it go through many ups and downs as far as quality content. over the last few months, it seems to be mostly articles & memes getting posted, which isn't a bad thing, but we are definitely missing out some research and information on all the exciting things being built in web3.  i'm going to start writing about applications and protocols i have experimented with in hopes to elevate the level of discourse on the sub.

while i will seek to provide accurate information, none of the postings are financial investment advice. users should do their own research and always practice good security measures when trying out a new protocol. 



**dd write-up:** 

over the last few years, a lot of really interesting defi products have hit the market. we've seen automated liquidity managers (alms), restaking protocols, intent-based solvers for swaps, composable onchain lending, etc. one of these fields that really excites me liquidity coordination platforms, and turtle is one of these platforms i've very much enjoyed using.

for those who don't know, i work for polygon. i've always been active in defi and i was thrilled to see katana (a defi-focused chain incubated by polygon) partner with turtle to help bolster initial liquidity on the chain. i think it‚Äôs worth explaining why i find it powerful from a liquidity mining perspective.

so what is turtle?

tl;dr - turtle is a defi liquidity coordination platform that connects projects with a base of defi yield-focused users by running structured campaigns to deliver higher yields & boosted points to liquidity providers (lps) while helping protocols & chains acquire long-term liquidity (vs mercenary liquidity).

turtle runs structured campaigns with partner projects that want to attract defi-native liquidity.  the campaigns often offer high yields or points boosts for pre-tge projects.  as an example, on katana's lbtc pool, you're able to earn kat rewards + 4x lombard lux points + 3x veda points + points/turtle boost (5-10%). ¬†for anyone farming points seriously, these boosts are very attractive.

essentially, turtle has become known as a hub for defi users to get the most of their yield. projects want these users, so they partner with turtle and give turtle users boosted yields. projects pay to access that base, and turtle passes part of that value back to users through boosts. the roi for projects can be better than running their own wide-open liquidity mining because the incentives are targeted, coordinated, and more likely to reach sticky users.  

as an example, for katana, while users can withdraw their liquidity at any time, to receive full rewards they need to leave their liquidity in the vaults for 60-90 days, depending on the campaign.  however, this long term incentive helps the chain bootstrap their liquidity instead of spending a tremendous of time sourcing it from vcs and other bd efforts.

vaults are curated and managed by some of the most respected teams in the space like gauntlet, stakehouse, yearn, and 7seas. in addition to the vault curators, other partners include teams like tac, katana, morpho, etherfi, lombard, veda, euler, and merkl (i'm probably forgetting some).

as far as ux/ui goes, turtle is super straightforward. you can view both campaigns (for chains) or deals (for protocols) based on what you want to do. you then deposit directly on the turtle frontend and start earning. one of the best features is turtle never takes custody of member assets and there are no smart contracts involved. you simply connect your wallet to turtle and then receive the rewards when the projects payout. this means that even if you unknowingly deposit into a turtle partner protocol, you will still receive boosted incentives. turtle tracks participation through api integrations with partner protocols.

**disclosures / disclaimers:** 

none of this is risk-free. you‚Äôre still taking defi risk when you deposit into any vault or campaign. i‚Äôm not qualified to audit smart contracts, and even a well-run program can fail. personally, i‚Äôve been impressed with how turtle approaches risk management and partnerships, but you should still size positions accordingly.

- **i've been diving deep into crypto spam resistance lately, especially after some frustrating ai chats that kept hyping bitcoin's ""unbeatable"" pow while downplaying nano's massive upgrades.**

- **with bitcoin still dealing with ordinals/runes spam and nano rolling out killer anti-spam features in v28.1, i thought it'd be helpful to lay out a full, evidence-based comparison.**

- **this isn't shilling  nano has its adoption hurdles, and bitcoin is king for a reason,but on pure spam defense? nano wins hands down in 2025.**

- **spam attacks here mean flooding networks with junk transactions to congest, bloat, or disrupt (e.g., ddos-style floods, dust attacks, or content embedding like nfts).**

- **i'll break it down by mechanics, recent issues, and why nano's feeless model isn't the weakness it's painted as.**

- **quick background:**

  - **bitcoin: proof-of-work (pow) blockchain with fees. miners prioritize high-fee tx; low-fee spam gets delayed/dropped. but segwit discounts (75% off witness data) enable cheap data spam.**

  - **nano: feeless block-lattice with open representative voting (orv). each tx requires sender pow; upgrades add prioritization and limits to thwart floods.**

- **key spam types and how each handles them:**

  - **transaction floods (pure spam):**

    - **bitcoin: fees deter during high demand (e.g., $10+ per tx in peaks), but cheap in lulls (1-5 sat/vbyte = <$0.01). mempool can bloat, delaying legit tx.**

i wanted some opinions/suggestions/assistance with a current crypto situation.

a guy i'm dating suggested this new coin. so i pumped almost $1500 into a ca and want to cash out or at least ""send"" it to myself on cashapp and cash it out to my bank account. 

the guy i'm seeing said i need to put another $500 into the ca in order for it to be able to swap or cash it out. but, based on what my base app is telling me, i just need some assets that are on the bnb network (same network as this new coin), and i can then swap it out to a ca of my choice, which would be the bitcoin wallet connected to my cashapp. 

the guy i'm dating originally told me after the first or second infusion of cash to the ca he sent me, that i would be able to withdraw. then it was ""okay, one more time and you should be able to cash out,"" but now he's saying it needs one more infusion of cash in order to make it be eligible to cash out!!!

and he's also saying that the ca is closing tomorrow and all the $ in my wallet will be worth nothing. it's of note that last weekend he also told me the ca was closing, but he said it was set to close ""on monday,"" as in this past monday, 4 days ago!!!

screenshot is  attached for reference. any information and/or resources you can point me to would be greatly appreciated!!! and, i specifically want to know the following:

1. is he just asking me to put more $ in so he can just take my $ for himself in his own ca/wallet and scamming me?
2. is this the normal for crypto? you have to put money in a ca then that ca account pushed money back to you? 
3. when a ca closes, does that truly render the funds in my wallet useless?
4. if it's not useless, can i do the following to get the $ to my bank account? 
    * buy another coin that's also on the bnb network to have it as an asset -> go to my wallet and ""send"" the funds to the ca -> connected to my cashapp crypto wallet -> cash out my cashapp crypto  wallet to my bank account connected to my cashapp

2025-08-15 01:20:29+00:00,"why do people think their blockchains are fully on chain? **look into the blockchain you invest in.**  
do not just take the marketing material or a social media post at face value. take the time to understand how it works, where it runs, and who controls it. many people assume that because something is called a blockchain it is automatically fully on chain, but that is rarely the case. aside from value focused blockchains like bitcoin, and execution focused blockchains such as ethereum, the only major platform that runs everything including compute, storage, governance, and execution fully on chain is the internet computer protocol. most others are hybrids at best or partially centralized ledgers presented as blockchains.

when we talk about a blockchain being on chain we are talking about more than just recording transactions in a public ledger. it means the application logic, state changes, and data storage actually live on the blockchain itself where they are verifiable, tamperproof, and run without reliance on third party servers. in a true on chain model, everything from the code to the data is hosted and executed by the decentralized network. remove a node or even multiple nodes and the system continues running because no part of it depends on a single party‚Äôs infrastructure.

most blockchains do not operate this way. they run a consensus layer on chain to record transactions, but push the heavy lifting off chain. smart contracts often store pointers to data rather than the data itself. applications usually run their frontends and backends on centralized services like aws, google cloud, or other traditional hosting. even in networks with many validators, the core application stack can still be dependent on centralized infrastructure for hosting, computation, or indexing. if that off chain infrastructure goes down, the application breaks even if the ledger is still technically online.

this hybrid setup creates several problems. it weakens the tamperproof claim because if your backend logic or user interface is controlled by a single company it can be altered or shut down without consensus from the network. it increases the attack surface because hacks and exploits often occur when the off chain backend or bridge is compromised. these incidents are not blockchain ledger breaches but failures caused by centralized components that sit outside the chain.

we see this pattern repeatedly. the headlines about millions of dollars stolen from a protocol often trace back to a compromised front end, a faulty library, or an insecure key. the blockchain ledger itself remains untouched, but because the application logic lives off chain, an attacker can reroute funds or trick users into approving malicious transactions. these incidents happen because the system was never truly self contained on chain to begin with.

icp was built to avoid this problem entirely. its architecture allows developers to deploy canisters, which are smart contracts that can contain both code and data, directly to the blockchain. the frontend, backend, and database can all be hosted on chain and served directly from the network to the user‚Äôs browser without intermediaries. this removes the need for aws buckets, centralized backends, or hidden infrastructure dependencies. the code running your application is exactly what you can verify on the blockchain.

ethereum offers an open execution environment where smart contracts live on chain and run without central servers. however, because ethereum is expensive and slower for high volume storage and complex computation, many applications built on ethereum rely on off chain infrastructure for parts of their stack. this is a practical trade off, but it blurs the line between being on chain and being merely anchored to a blockchain.

value based blockchains like bitcoin operate differently. they focus entirely on securing the transfer of value and maintaining a censorship resistant ledger. they do not claim to run applications or host data on chain, so they avoid the mismatch between expectation and reality. their simplicity contributes to their security.

for other blockchains, the marketing often paints a picture of a fully decentralized self contained system when that is not the truth. the moment you realize that the application you use depends on a centralized backend you should also realize that the guarantees of decentralization and tamperproof operation no longer fully apply. this is why so many exploits are possible. attackers target the weak links, and in most so called blockchains, those weak links are off chain.

if you are investing in a project, understand the difference between a ledger on chain and a full application on chain. ledger only platforms can be fine for certain use cases, but they will never provide the same guarantees as a network where the entire stack, from smart contract logic to user facing code, is decentralized. icp proves that it is possible. the question is whether the others even want to try, because moving to a fully on chain architecture would require fundamentally rethinking their business models and governance structures.

until then, the next time someone claims their favorite blockchain is fully on chain, ask them where the application logic runs, where the data lives, and what happens if their chosen cloud provider shuts down for a week. if they cannot answer without naming a centralized service, you will know exactly how on chain it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mqji9q/why_do_people_think_their_blockchains_are_fully/,23,95,1mqji9q,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.0971

right now, we‚Äôre seeing a familiar pattern: btc and eth surged, and now prices are starting to dip again. it‚Äôs the same story every cycle. new people jump in during the hype, the price goes up even more, and then reality sets in. those who over-invested or put in more than they can afford to lose become nervous, scared and highly reactive to negative change. a small drop in price occurs, and suddenly, the emotional chain reaction of sell-offs begins. huge drop in price incoming.

when this happens, just take a breath.

this kind of volatility is normal. what you‚Äôre seeing is weak hands getting shaken out. it‚Äôs not the end. it never is.

the best advice i can give: **zoom out**. look at the big picture. over any 2‚Äì3 year period in crypto history, if you held strong and didn‚Äôt try to trade every wave, you were likely rewarded. crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. it‚Äôs a long game.

i've been in crypto since the 2020 crash and subsequent market boom in 2021. last time around, as crypto was heating up, there was a noted rise in public comment: an nfl player requesting his salary in bitcoin instead of dollars, bitcoin purchase stations being added to us gas stations, and even that goddamn superbowl commercial.

it was a time for trotting out a longtime crypto concept: everyone feels like a genius in the boom times.

once bitcoin got mentioned on my dad's local news station, even he started talking about it, and how his (elderly) neighbors were all aware that it was a crazy scam.

the real sign of the times, though, was when my co-workers decided to start talking about bitcoin and their ""altcoin portfolios"" at lunch. mind you: these are people who don't own stocks, laughed at me when i told them i used our company's 401-k matching offer, and let multiple people know that their ultimate retirement plan is to win a couple of big scratch-off lottery tickets. (you know, because if they buy a few every week for life, they're ""guaranteed"" to win a big one or two.)

then the bubble burst and my co-workers all shut the hell up about crypto except for one who admitted their paper hands folding. (i suspect all of them traded at a loss instead of waiting 5 years for this run-up.)

anyway, the circle is becoming complete again: my co-worker lunch table is talking loudly about doge and other altcoins and how they're going to get vacation homes soon.

you know the rest, cryptofam: if you've been dcaing since the 2021 crash, we're back into the public talking phase. will the bigger fireworks go off? bitcoin hitting 122k was a big damn firework, for sure, but will we see something more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mp957l/my_coworkers_are_using_the_term_altcoins_at_lunch/,69,35,1mp957l,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,-0.7615

# what perfect storm of events could help fuel a melt-up?

**-fear desensitization: heavy market fear for over a year, but with no consequences as the price still gets new aths:**

first off, it always helps when the market has already had most of its major fear out of the way.

and it might even have been increasingly desensitized from fear.

the market has already gone through months in recent years of fears of threats of nuclear war, major recession, tariff wars, covid variants, economic trouble all around the world, along with monthly crypto fud we had for over a year, from the crypto banking collapse to the recent xmr fear of a 51% attack. it's been one after another.

there's been an overload of fear, now mostly blown over, that will make it difficult to out-do.

it might even turn into a boy who cried wolf situation, even if there is legitimate fear coming up.

especially now that people see that despite all the fear we had, it didn't stop bitcoin from going past $120k.

**-m1 m2 money supply** has been climbing more sharply, and is forecast to continue this trend. while bitcoin has been falling behind. this is probably the trend that the crypto market has loved following the most, historically.

**-fed rate cuts.**

fed cuts haven't even started yet. it's unlikely we have even seen the biggest gains yet without any cuts started.

**- crypto etfs, 401ks, sovereign funds, coporate funds, etc...**

there's more and more of these big funds loading up on crypto. and some have only just started. it's starting to also look like they might be moving into alts also.

**-continuously pro-crypto us government, along with other nations warming up to crypto.**

the us government has continued its pro-crypto policies, as seen with its most recent bills to help the crypto space. but if you look around the world, it's not the only government that's increasingly more pro-crypto. one interesting area are the gulf states, which haven't been talked about much, but seem to be increasingly pro-crypto, and are rumored to be working on their own crypto sovereign funds.

**-fud and negative narratives are fading from mainstream media, and getting increasingly replaced by hype.**

2025-08-13 12:27:46+00:00,"what is value and price, and why bitcoin‚Äôs price will keep rising we all know the words ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and ‚Äúprice‚Äù, but what do they really mean, and what‚Äôs the difference between them? why are some things worth millions while others are worth nothing at all? what role do society, resources, time, and even culture play in shaping these concepts?

let‚Äôs start with definitions:

**value** ‚Äì a subjective perception of the importance, usefulness, or significance of something. it‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind why something matters or doesn‚Äôt.

**price** ‚Äì a quantitative expression of value (usually in money), showing exactly how much something costs in numerical terms.

for example: the item with the highest value to a human ‚Äì water ‚Äì has a low price in most regions, while a useless memecoin has no real value at all but may sometimes carry a high price.

# types of price

price is a tool for measurement and exchange.

**exchange value** ‚Äì the foundation of a market economy, showing how much other goods or money one can get for an item.  
example: 1 btc = 110,000 usd or 1 btc = 1,617 barrels of oil. in a market economy, exchange value is driven by market price, determined by supply and demand.

**imputed value** ‚Äì the estimated value of a good or service based on expert calculation, analogy, or assumed usefulness rather than market mechanisms. used in government policy, ecosystem service evaluation, social policy, tender bids, and in valuing public goods where market-based pricing is impossible.

**cost price** ‚Äì the sum of all actual expenses incurred to produce and deliver a product or service to the consumer. it includes raw materials, labor, equipment depreciation, rent, energy, taxes, and other costs. it defines the minimum price at which a product can be sold without incurring a loss.

**intrinsic value (fair value)** ‚Äì a theoretically justified valuation of an asset, company, or project based on fundamentals: profits, cash flows, assets and liabilities, growth prospects, and market risks.  
example: an investor calculates that a company‚Äôs stock is worth $100, but it trades at $70. he concludes it‚Äôs an undervalued asset and buys.

# types of value

value is multidimensional and can be classified both by its source and by how it‚Äôs perceived.

**utilitarian value** ‚Äì usefulness, ranging from life-essential (water, food, oxygen) to nearly useless (souvenirs) and even negative utility (harmful items like cigarettes). the price of highly useful goods depends on time and place. for example, a bottle of water is cheap almost everywhere, but in a desert emergency its price can skyrocket.

**emotional value** ‚Äì tied to personal feelings or memories, such as a childhood toy or a gift from a loved one. for most people, such an item is worthless, but for one person, it can be priceless.

**cultural value** ‚Äì connected to history, art, and tradition. this includes antiques, vintage items, and objects that represent important symbols (religious, national, etc.).

**social value** ‚Äì what‚Äôs important in the eyes of others. these are status-signaling items like luxury watches, expensive cars, or limited-edition sneakers. often, the brand and scarcity are the main drivers of price.

**existential value** ‚Äì things that cannot be expressed in monetary terms: freedom, life, love, worldview.

# factors affecting price

here are 15 key factors that shape the final price:

1. production costs (cost price)
2. rarity
3. supply and demand (plus liquidity)
4. competition

# why bitcoin‚Äôs price will rise

bitcoin is a completely new asset class. it‚Äôs not a commodity, stock, or bond, so traditional valuation methods like intrinsic value or fair value don‚Äôt apply.

what it does have: cost of production, average market price, trading volumes, and liquidity.

bitcoin through the 15 price factors:

1. cost price ‚Äì driven by mining costs, mainly electricity and taxes. halving increases cost price over time.
2. rarity ‚Äì supply limited to 21 million btc; decreasing over time due to lost keys.
3. supply and demand ‚Äì 560m crypto holders, $10‚Äì20b spot volume, $40‚Äì60b with futures & etfs. etfs expand access.
4. competition ‚Äì altcoins are not real competitors; the only rival is gold.
5. government regulation ‚Äì u.s. acceptance is a global green light; states and companies now hold btc.
6. logistics ‚Äì irrelevant except for transaction fees.
7. technology ‚Äì debated, but simple, reliable, decentralized.
8. brand ‚Äì bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency.
9. marketing ‚Äì best ad is rising price.
10. consumer psychology ‚Äì veblen effect boosts demand.
11. traditions & culture ‚Äì btc is culturally neutral.
12. currencies ‚Äì correlated with usd.
13. inflation ‚Äì makes btc attractive, especially in high-inflation countries.
14. bubbles ‚Äì bitcoin thrives in speculative growth cycles.
15. geopolitics ‚Äì potential to behave like gold in crises.

# conclusion

bitcoin is almost the perfect asset for price growth, as it checks nearly all key factors driving value higher. the only serious threats are mining pool collusion (51% attack) and quantum computing, both unlikely in the near term. other risks may cause short-term drops but aren‚Äôt existential.

if you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, monero is how you actually do it.

so you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it‚Äôs now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. they took zero risk in that trade. when banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. when you win, they take a cut. when you lose, they vanish.

monero fixes that. nobody knows your 50 bucks of btc turned into 2k if you swap through monero. no blockchain trail, no reporting, no ‚Äúoops, i forgot to declare my gains‚Äù with your name all over a public ledger.

and for those who support drug legalization‚Ä¶ you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren‚Äôt using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you‚Äôre just talking. monero enables that market today.

here‚Äôs the play:

* the us holds **261.5m ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices ü§Ø).
* market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.
* if revalued, treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the fed, instantly crediting **\~$900b** without selling a single bar.
* no new debt, just‚Ä¶ magic money backed by gold.

it‚Äôs been done before:

* **1933:** fdr confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.
* **1971‚Äì73:** nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, treasury revalued, pocketed \~$800m without selling gold.

why now?

* fed‚Äôs own memo (aug 1) points to other countries doing it ‚Äî germany, italy, lebanon, south africa.
* analysts like luke gromen say revaluing to **$20k/oz** could free up **$5t**, slashing us debt-to-gdp from 122% ‚Üí \~70%.
* trump‚Äôs treasury officials are hinting it‚Äôs ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù

the crypto twist:

* last year, sen. cynthia lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy bitcoin** for a us strategic reserve ‚Äî ‚Äúbudget-neutral.‚Äù
* trump‚Äôs crypto advisor called it ‚Äúthe best way‚Äù to get btc without taxing americans.

why this matters for bitcoin:

1. if fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets ‚Äî gold *and* btc.
2. state-level btc accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.
3. but‚Ä¶ big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.

bottom line:

we don‚Äôt know exactly when a powerful enough quantum computer will be built, but it‚Äôs clear that it will happen sooner or later. most current blockchains, including bitcoin and ethereum, would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. efforts are underway to upgrade these blockchains, but it‚Äôs a challenging process that will take time ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no guarantee the fixes will be ready before the threat becomes real.

it‚Äôs worth noting that there are already post-quantum cryptocurrencies designed to withstand this risk from the start. they use quantum-safe signature schemes like xmss or sphincs+, which cannot be broken by shor‚Äôs algorithm. a few of these coins are live today, but most are only available on small, niche exchanges with low liquidity.

now let's say the us dollar collapses because they can no longer service their national debt.  let's say the us dollar is worth 1/10th of what it usually is. 

would this also drop bitcoin by almost the same amount considering how much investment was made originally in usd? or does bitcoin price stay the same because once the coin is bought it doesnt have a direct relationship to the currency it was purchased with?

on one hand it could be treated as it's own commodity and could retain its value on the world market, it would just cost 10 times more usd to buy a coin. 

but on the other hand if people started cashing out their bitcoin into usd theoretically the ""stockpile"" of usd that went into it wouldnt be enough to service all the people who wanted to cash out.

2025-08-11 08:57:44+00:00,"how to take profits like a pro during the upcoming crypto run. there are roughly 4 phases during the bull run. they might overlap with each other for a while.

1. btc pumps, the rest just sucks ft. eth. any coin vs. btc (pair) is tanking, nobody is excited except the btc maxis cause 99% degens on this sub own alts.
2. eth wakes up (+- current situation) and we have a gigantic volatility on eth/btc chart, money moves between those 2 + some major alts. eth folks, after being ridiculed for year(s) with btc/eth charts, start to get some confidence and we get the classical flippening yelling. eth is gonna flip/overtake btc (which of course will never happen)
3. eth season is done and we have a situation where money flows from eth into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). there will be several cycles, not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump. alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping.
4. finally, once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

the latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into btc again. the alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ath (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

you also don't keep all of your converted btc when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for fiat (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. you can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 10-20% apy while your fiat gets you close to zero apy when you move it to your bankster's place.

once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy btc again because nobody is buying btc at atl except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top = ath hopefully) and finally 25% that's left for one last profit taking.

basically, you sell gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto and sell heavily +- 50% of your bag when you feel that this is gonna be as good as it gets (you'll never get the top so anything close to it = before and/or after ath is great).

i'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. ok, bye.

**genius act**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **guiding and establishing national innovation for u.s. stablecoins**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **the first ever framework for stablecoin regulations**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **the bank secrecy act now covers providers of stablecoin yasssss**

**clarity act**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **definition outlined for sftc and sec oversight of cryptocurrency**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **provides clarity for which digital assets are a commodity versus a security**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **trading platforms need to provide disclosure agreements or rules and to custody crypto**

**anti-cbdc surveillance state act**

* **federal reserve may not launch a cbdc central bank digital currency**
* **helps safeguard financial privacy and overreach by the government**

**these 3 bills provide a major shift of cryptocurrency from suspicion to adoption. yes, we always talk about mass adoption and here we are folks, the future of cryptocurrency 1 step at a time!**

**now it‚Äôs been a few weeks since crypto week and since the bills have passed. how are the effects of crypto week thus far?**

**cryptocurrency markets surging! ethereum headed towards ath with bitcoin maintaining structure. institutions are heavily investing in cryptocurrencies and stablecoins! operation choke point 2.0 has halted, allowing cryptocurrency services to access services provided by banks. regulators are working with banks to define rules for stablecoin creation and custody! executive order was signed by willy wonka to let cryptocurrency be investable through 401k plans, super awesome! irs is trying to make the tax process for cryptocurrency simpler, hopefully no more having to use services to go through all of my transactions each year haha.**

**with crypto week and it‚Äôs effects, we have an amazing positive outlook for cryptocurrency, especially in the united states. hopefully this momentum continues for years and into the future beyond infinity. thank you to all of the early adopters leading to this historic moment towards mass adoption, we have succeeded. however, it is still early so newcomers shouldn‚Äôt feel they have come into the space late! it‚Äôs like the dot com boom, but this time it‚Äôs different. cryptocurrency is here to stay.**

2025-08-10 01:52:09+00:00,"eth dominance is rising, alt season is potentially around the corner. **eth season is here, and it is glorious!**

eth has punched through the 4k barrier in the last few days, and even touched 4.3k a couple of times. i expect there will be a bit more of a tug of war before the next break out.

in the last 30 days, eth is +46% while the market leader, btc, is just +1%.

from 0.025 to 0.036 in the eth/btc ratio.

in the last 90 days, eth is +71% the market leader, btc, is +11%.

we can see from the graph and stats below, eth dominance has risen quite nicely compared to the rest of the market.

history doesn't always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.

throwback to the last cycle; after btc dominance reaches it's high, eth moves next, followed by the mythical alt-season!

granted, there are a lot more projects up and running now, but we have seen the first step, which is eth start to rise accordingly. should history rhyme, eth will continue to out-perform the market leader for another period of time, until the markets become euphoric and we enter the alt-season.

[https://www.thealtsignal.com/](https://www.thealtsignal.com/) according to the alt-signal we are now 3/6 checks highlighting this!

as i said, history doesn't always repeat itself, but it often rhymes, and a lot is different this time round in terms of sentiment, regulation, adoption, politics, economy etc, but at the same time; if the crypto-cycle continues once again, we are in for one hell of a ride!

2025-08-07 14:51:29+00:00,"a deep dive into qrl: the quantum-safe blockchain quantum computing is no longer science fiction ‚Äî it‚Äôs progressing fast. and with it comes a very real threat to the cryptography that underpins nearly every blockchain in existence.  
  
so‚Ä¶ if quantum risk is inevitable, where do you place your bet? and is $qrl the most credible hedge in the entire crypto space?¬†let‚Äôs break it down.  


**my discovery of quantum resistant crypto**

i‚Äôve been interested in quantum computing for years, even investing in quantum tech etfs recently. it was clear that fields like medicine and energy would benefit from quantum ‚Äî but then i started wondering about crypto. if quantum computers can break encryption that traditional systems can‚Äôt, what does that mean for bitcoin, ethereum, and the rest?  
  
i quickly learned that ecdsa, used to secure most blockchains, is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks. at first, i assumed the fix would be simple ‚Äî just upgrade the cryptography. but once i dug deeper, it became clear that upgrading legacy chains would be a slow, messy process requiring global coordination.  
that led me to explore projects focused on quantum security from the start. i found a few ‚Äî qrl, qanx, and cell ‚Äî and eventually concluded that qrl is the most credible bet in my opinion. it‚Äôs a purpose-built blockchain using xmss at the protocol level, and the community is focused, technical, and refreshingly hype-free.  


**qrl is built different: quantum security at the core**

while most blockchains still rely on outdated signature schemes like ecdsa, qrl has used xmss ‚Äî a hash-based, quantum-resistant signature algorithm ‚Äî from the start. this means it doesn‚Äôt just talk about post-quantum security. it runs on it.  
  
xmss is secure against quantum attacks and doesn‚Äôt rely on factorization or elliptic curves ‚Äî the very structures quantum computers are expected to break. unlike the ‚Äúfuture upgrade paths‚Äù of legacy chains, qrl‚Äôs cryptography is already designed for a quantum world.  
  
and it gets better.  
  
with the upcoming zond platform (qrl 2.0), qrl will introduce support for sphincs+, a stateless, hash-based signature scheme recently selected for global standardization. this adds even more flexibility and resilience to qrl‚Äôs architecture, giving developers the option to choose between multiple quantum-safe primitives ‚Äî all without compromising on-chain security. after the update, existing wallets remain quantum-secure and can be upgraded to the new format at any time.  


**born too early**

let‚Äôs rewind to 2018. qrl launched its mainnet. it never gained much traction in the altcoin scene and flew under the radar for years.  
  
why?

* the 2018 bear market nuked everything
* quantum risk felt 20 years away
* no smart contracts, no defi ecosystem
* devs stayed heads-down, no vc or pr push
* very limited exchange listings
* bittrex listing was a hard lesson learned

basically: wrong timing, right idea.  


**the world is catching up**

quantum computing is no longer theoretical. it‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs advancing fast, and it‚Äôs now hitting headlines that matter:

big tech is all-in: ibm, google, and many quantum specific companies such as ionq, rigetti etc. ‚Äî all scaling up quantum hardware year over year with massive investments.

white house warning (july 2025): quantum computers could ""derive any digital asset holder‚Äôs private key from their public key."" and ""some experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge in the next five to ten years.""

blackrock (may 2025): etf filings flagged quantum as a direct risk to bitcoin. 

elon musk asked grok (august 2025) if quantum computers could crack sha-256. grok's answer was that sha-256 might be okay for a while. however, elon didn't ask about ecdsa which is the lowest hanging fruit for quantum computer and biggest risk currently.¬†deloitte estimates \~25% of bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum theft due to exposed public keys.

ecdsa ‚Äî the digital signature algorithm used by bitcoin, ethereum, and most wallets ‚Äî is exactly what shor‚Äôs algorithm breaks. and it breaks it fast.

forbes and wsj writing about quantum threats: 

* forbes: ""the quantum threat to encryption: how businesses can future-proof""
* wsj: ""here‚Äôs how quantum computing could change the world"". ""quantum has so often been spoken about as something that was always coming in the next five or 10 years,‚Äù kohler said. ‚Äúthe conversations are changing dramatically because it‚Äôs now no longer 10 years down the road. it‚Äôs much closer.‚Äù



**why legacy chains can‚Äôt just ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù**

many assume bitcoin or ethereum will just ‚Äúswitch to quantum-safe‚Äù one day.  
here‚Äôs the problem:

* protocol-level changes require global coordination
* you‚Äôd need consensus from miners, validators, exchanges, and users
* every old wallet and smart contract would need to migrate
* abandoned keys could be stolen forever
* it‚Äôs not just a software upgrade ‚Äî it‚Äôs a political nightmare.

even partial fixes (like signature overlays or hybrid key pairs) won‚Äôt solve the root issue. once quantum hits, it‚Äôs not patchable ‚Äî it‚Äôs a chain-wide vulnerability.  
  
bitcoin developer hunter beast discusses about the topic in the bitcoin rails podcast ""make bitcoin quantum resistant - with hunter beast"".  


**centralized systems are already preparing**

meanwhile, financial institutions are already preparing for the quantum threat. unlike decentralized blockchains, banks and centralized platforms can implement post-quantum algorithms more easily, thanks to centralized control, layered security, and fast upgrade cycles.  
  
they don‚Äôt need global consensus or to rescue abandoned wallets. they can simply roll out post-quantum security behind closed doors. the hard truth? legacy blockchains are structurally less agile when it comes to cryptographic overhauls.  


**state-level threats: quiet and strategic**

the real quantum threat may not come from hackers ‚Äî but from nation-states with the budget, motive, and secrecy to act before the world catches up.

***what could they do?***

* silently drain dormant wallets with exposed public keys
* decrypt sensitive communications, from top-secret memos to financial data
* harvest encrypted traffic now, and decrypt it later with quantum power

***why it won‚Äôt be obvious***

governments wouldn‚Äôt use quantum to collapse bitcoin ‚Äî especially if they‚Äôve already restricted it domestically. instead, they‚Äôd act quietly and selectively, exploiting vulnerabilities without shaking the system.  
  
the threat isn‚Äôt chaos. it‚Äôs control ‚Äî and they won‚Äôt announce when they get it.  
  
during a recent u.s. congressional oversight hearing, it was noted that:  
***‚Äúwe don‚Äôt even know the names of quantum computing companies in china.""***  
‚Äî fabaiquantum, jul 1, 2025 on x  
  
the united states office of management and budget has drafted a memorandum that directs federal agencies to fully migrate to a post-quantum cryptographic standard:   
***""everything must migrate to post-quantum cryptography, cryptocurrencies included.""***  
‚Äî qdayclock, jul 17, 2025 on x



**limited listings ‚Äî for now**

qrl is currently listed on just a few smaller exchanges like mexc, banxa and lbank. daily volume is low, and there‚Äôs no tier-1 listing yet. it's possible to acquire qrl but takes an extra effort.  
  
a future binance or coinbase listing would dramatically increase visibility, liquidity, and credibility. as quantum security gains attention from regulators and institutions, tier-1 exchanges may start favoring post-quantum assets ‚Äî and qrl is one of the few ready now.



**community recap**

despite being one of the most technically sound projects in crypto, qrl has flown under the radar for years ‚Äî and so has its community. there‚Äôs no influencer campaigns, and no hype cycles driving engagement. just a small but growing base of long-term holders, technologists, and security-minded crypto users.

* the qrl subreddit remains active with updates, research, and user-led discussions.
* devs regularly publish progress on github and engage with the community through blog posts and discord.
* the team has stayed focused on delivery ‚Äî not marketing.

what you‚Äôll find here isn‚Äôt noise ‚Äî it‚Äôs signal. the community is small, but conviction is high. and as quantum awareness grows, those watching qrl now may be the earliest of the early.  


**my path to qrl owner**

after doing my due diligence about qrl, what has really convinced me was project zond (qrl 2.0). if it succeeds, developers could migrate ethereum-style smart contracts to a quantum-safe layer with minimal changes. that could be a turning point ‚Äî both for qrl adoption and visibility. i believe a tier 1 listing and real marketing push could follow. so i bought in early ‚Äî before the headlines hit.

to be honest, the restricted market access for qrl was almost a deal-breaker. but i believed the project had real potential, so i opened a mexc account (which seemed like a good option from europe). despite the mixed reviews, everything worked smoothly in my experience.  
  
i was able to make a fiat transfer, convert eur to usdt, buy qrl, and withdraw it to my ledger after installing the qrl app. it took a bit of extra effort ‚Äî but no issues at all.

my investment horizon is 3‚Äì10+ years. by then, it‚Äôs likely that q-day has happened ‚Äî and it‚Äôll be interesting to see where qrl stands. i believe the first truly quantum-resistant blockchain will have survived the turbulence and likely attracted many crypto holders looking to protect their assets. time will tell.  


  
**tl;dr**

* qrl was too early in 2018. now it might be right on time.
* quantum computing is accelerating
* legacy chains are structurally hard to upgrade
* qrl runs quantum-safe cryptography right now
* zond adds future-ready flexibility
* institutional attention is growing
* and almost no one‚Äôs looking ‚Äî yet

some key details:

‚Ä¢ decibel acts as a full-stack exchange engine. it lets users trade spot and perpetuals from a single multicollateral account (supports apt, usdc, btc, eth, sol, and others).

‚Ä¢ every trade, match, and cancel happens onchain, nothing is routed offchain.

‚Ä¢ liquidity is unified across products. protocol vaults and user-managed vaults can both contribute to market-making.

‚Ä¢ supports direct onboarding from other chains and cexs, with no new seed phrases needed.

‚Ä¢ the underlying aptos blockchain is designed for high throughput and fast block times (currently 120ms, aiming for sub-20ms), which enables cex-like performance.

aptos defi has been growing steadily this year, hitting over $1b tvl and significant stablecoin inflows (see messari‚Äôs h1 2025 aptos report for data). decibel aims to turn what‚Äôs currently a patchwork of separate protocols into a more unified and composable experience, both for users and developers.

the real opportunity with¬†**shiba coin (shic)**¬†is¬†*before*¬†that happens. right now the community is small, the price is quiet, and barely anyone is paying attention. that‚Äôs exactly the kind of stage where life-changing gains are made. by the time alt season headlines arrive, it‚Äôs too late ‚Äî the big move has already happened.

shic isn‚Äôt just another erc-20 like shib. it‚Äôs a real blockchain, forked from dogecoin, merge-mined with doge and ltc, and secured by proof-of-work. the launch was fair ‚Äî no presale, no premine, not even for the developers. distribution is healthy, with the largest wallet holding only around 5% of the supply. and unlike most meme projects, shic already has real utility : you can tip it on reddit and discord today.

alt season rewards the ones who positioned themselves early, not the ones chasing green candles at the top. shic is still in its ‚Äúfamily-sized‚Äù phase, and history shows this is when the smartest entries happen.

so the choice is simple: buy when it‚Äôs quiet, or wait until alt season to become exit liquidity for those who didn‚Äôt.

well now then what is bitcoin? bitcoin has no utility it has an idea behind it. so what it is? it‚Äôs a pure belief asset (pba) in which a community of people fell in love with its inspiring narrative (which the og bag workers of bitcoin built out) the goal: to disrupt traditional finance, first appearing post 2008 financial crisis as a peer to peer transactional intermediary meant to cut out wall street

the only reason it holds value is due to fact that people believe it does and this all steams from the underlying community. without og delusional bag workers its doesn‚Äôt exist today. you can pretend that it was simply the tech behind it and that it was inevitable but without the og delusion bulls who built out that narrative that you think you now understand it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt exist

so when bidding coins you want to look for organic fairly distributed projects that‚Äôs are community based. if you must bid utilities coins look for those that have good enough tech and narrative for a legitimate community to form ($eth)

if youve read this far i beg you to check out #spx6900 like just look into it

this is the next iteration of a pure belief asset with a similar narrative of rebellion to bitcoin

in a time when more and more average americans are getting priced out of their local restaurants people are going to look towards alternative investments/ revolution 

many people are slowly subscribing to the idea that the system is broken so let‚Äôs tear it down, seen with the growing popularity of socialist u.s representatives across the country

the answer isn‚Äôt pro socialist policy it‚Äôs getting involved into the pure side of capitalism: activism

first up is their treasury. they‚Äôve already announced holdings of 5.5 bitcoin and now a policy to add ethereum. the next step is for them to actually show that they‚Äôre getting more mined bitcoin from their partnership. they also plan to start tokenizing real-world assets and are looking to generate some yield from defi.  if they keep releasing clean dashboards on their progress and those key performance indicators keep trending up, it could be a major catalyst. with a really tight float, any good news could move the needle a lot. the best part is that their leadership is incentivized to hit these goals, which is a big plus in my book. 

the whole approach feels more grounded in execution than just pure hype. instead of hearing big promises, we're seeing them outline specific, measurable steps. it really puts the power back in the hands of us, the investors, to follow along and see if they can deliver. it makes me wonder what other kinds of partnerships or tech they could be working on behind the scenes that haven‚Äôt been announced yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mtq2u4/a_new_playbook_for_a_microcap_with_a_big_goal/,8,1,1mtq2u4,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9856

some pointers from me:

bitcoin only has limited coins. unlike dollars, bitcoin‚Äôs supply is fixed, so it could gain value over time.

prices move a lot in crypto. most people who try to time the market end up buying high and selling low. holding avoids a lot of those mistakes.

the fomo also kicks in when you sell and the value start climbing up, a psychological panic creeps in and people end up buying on a high. 

nonetheless, imo we don't have to pick any strategy as a hard and fast rule. in many cases, just taking the profit and moving on makes perfect sense and that can many real life cases.

majority of analysts are believeing in somewhat range of 130k-145k range. this is kind of a safe instituitional forecast, but with bitcoin we have seen how wrong the analysts predictions can be in actually good sense.\\

mid-range optimists¬†are throwing around $150k-$170k targets.¬†investing haven's stretched targets go up to $174k-$181k.  the moonshot predictions¬†are getting crazy though. peter brandt is calling $200k. anthony scaramucci thinks $170k is doable.

what's driving this?¬†the institutional money keeps pouring in‚Äîblackrock's eth etf alone hit $10 billion. we've got the strategic bitcoin reserve thing happening in washington. the regulatory clarity act is moving through congress. supply shock from the halving. corporate treasuries adding btc.

somewhere between $130k-$160k feels realistic if current momentum holds. the $200k+ calls need everything to go perfect, but honestly? after watching bitcoin hit $124k when most people thought $100k was ambitious, maybe ""impossible"" targets aren't so impossible anymore.

2025-08-13 12:26:29+00:00,"without chainlink, crypto collapses ‚Äì why link might be the most important asset in the entire space most people see chainlink (link) as ‚Äújust an oracle project.‚Äù in my opinion, that‚Äôs like calling the internet ‚Äújust some computers connected together.‚Äù technically true, but missing the entire point.

i believe chainlink is the invisible infrastructure that keeps the entire crypto universe running ‚Äì and without it, things would grind to a halt faster than most realize.

**1. blockchains are blind without reliable external data**  
blockchains are fantastic at executing code. they can enforce agreements with mathematical certainty‚Ä¶ but only with the data they already have. they can‚Äôt natively know the price of eth in usd, whether it‚Äôs raining in new york, or if a stock market closed higher today.

chainlink solves this with secure, decentralized data feeds. that‚Äôs not just a convenience ‚Äì it‚Äôs critical. without trustworthy data, smart contracts would be stuck in a vacuum.

**2. billions of dollars already depend on chainlink every day**  
look at defi. platforms like aave, synthetix, gmx, and countless others rely on chainlink‚Äôs price feeds to determine collateral values, execute trades, or trigger liquidations.

if one data feed failed or was manipulated, it could cause cascading failures worth billions. link‚Äôs oracle network is one of the main reasons that hasn‚Äôt happened.

**3. it‚Äôs not just defi ‚Äì it‚Äôs everything**  
chainlink is moving beyond finance. it provides weather data for blockchain-based insurance. it enables real-world asset tokenization by linking traditional markets to blockchains.

and with ccip (cross-chain interoperability protocol), it‚Äôs bridging entire blockchains together. imagine bitcoin and ethereum talking to each other seamlessly, or a private bank network interacting with public chains ‚Äì that‚Äôs what ccip is aiming to deliver.

**4. the partnerships are on another level**  
google, swift, aws, dtcc, anz bank‚Ä¶ the list goes on. these aren‚Äôt speculative ‚Äúmaybe one day‚Äù partnerships ‚Äì they‚Äôre actual integrations, pilots, and testnets. chainlink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and web3.

**5. it‚Äôs the ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù of crypto ‚Äì and plumbing isn‚Äôt sexy**  
the average person doesn‚Äôt think about dns when they type a website address. they just expect it to work. in the same way, most people in crypto don‚Äôt think about where their price data comes from ‚Äì but without chainlink, their favorite defi app wouldn‚Äôt function.

that‚Äôs why link often flies under the radar: it‚Äôs critical, but invisible.

**so‚Ä¶ is link the most important crypto asset?**  
i think bitcoin is irreplaceable as a store of value. ethereum is unmatched as a general-purpose platform. but without chainlink, both lose a significant part of their functionality.

for me, link is like electricity. not as flashy as the devices it powers, but without it, nothing else works.

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, samson mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the ‚Äúbagholder‚Äôs dilemma.‚Äù current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

secomd, willy woo called bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

the real question isn't whether eth can pump another 12% to hit its ath. it's whether bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. and for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn‚Äôt losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype. either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnw5pl/eth_vs_btc_what_is_the_reality/,28,37,1mnw5pl,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9886

dr. richard werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. he may not have said the word ""bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.  
  
every so often, a conversation slices through the static of our daily news cycle and strikes at the very foundation of our reality. it doesn't just present new facts; it provides a new lens through which to see the world, revealing that the chaos we experience isn't random but a product of a hidden design. tucker carlson's recent interview with dr. richard werner was one such moment.  
  
werner, a german economist with a quiet demeanor that belies the explosive nature of his work, has been labeled by some as ‚Äúthe most dangerous economist in the world.‚Äù why? his core thesis doesn't just challenge a specific policy or critique a political party. it dynamites the entire bedrock of modern banking and economics, exposing the system for what it is: a mechanism of control, engineered for specific outcomes.  
  
throughout the conversation, werner methodically dismantled the comforting lies we are told about money. the result was a chillingly clear picture of how inflation, perpetual war, and crushing inequality are not unfortunate byproducts of a complex system, but rather the intended output of its engine. and in doing so, whether he intended to or not, he erected the single greatest billboard for bitcoin imaginable. he described the disease in such perfect detail that the cure became self-evident.

2025-08-07 19:03:31+00:00,"does tokenizing the newport landfill makes sense? james howells, an it worker from south wales, had used his laptop to 'mine' \~ 8000 units of digital bitcoin currency in 2009. he was the one of only 5 miners in 2009. in 2010, the dell xps n1710 broke after he spilt lemonade on it, so he dismantled the computer¬† for parts, kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it.

that hardrive is now sitting at newport landfill somewhere buried under 25,000 cubic meters of waste and earth"", weighing approximately 110,000‚Äì200,000 tonnes. to give you the scale, it could be anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch.

now, as per the latest news, the landfill site is set to permanently close in the 2025/26 financial year. the landfill has been in operation since the early 2000s and is nearing the end of its lifespan, hence the council is planning its closure. it will mean a loss of a predicted sum of just shy of ¬£1m for newport city council due to loss of revenes from disposal of commercial waste.

i feel that this presents a perfect opportunity to tokenize this landfill. the land can be leased for 5 years.  
now before tokenizing, would the hardrive be intact today or would have been galvanized ?  
howells believes the drive is still functional due to its protective casing and the anti-corrosive cobalt layer coating the glass disk.

britian isn't dubai or japan, so tokenizing direct 'landfill' might be difficult.

so, instead, we tokenized fund that will hold the lease to the landfill for next 5 years.  
that means:  
\- spvs.  
\- legal wrappers.  
\- some regulatory layers.  
\- miscellaneous costs

setting up tokenomics

total tokens - 21 million  
10% tokens held by james howells and the fund.  
out of the remaining 90% tokens, half i.e. 9.45 million tokens sold over public market at $1.05 thus netting $10 mln to take care of the operational cost.  
we can add vesting schedules if we want to.  
the remaining 50% tokens will be sold if bitcoin is found  
in the form of bitcoin treasury allocation.

the 8000 bitcoin is valued at \~ $950 mln today.

if you consider a rise of even 2x in bitcoin from here by next year then that's 20000% returns

using $10 mln raised funds

1. use of artificial intelligence using a mechanical arm to scan waste to identify the hard drive
2. using drones, and boston dynamics robotic dogs for security, 
3. 3.recruiting an ai specialist and an environmental team to the project.
4. experts in landfill excavation, and a data recovery advisor.

or, develop a community-owned mining facility on the landfill site. the facility would use solar or wind power and generate power revenues.

what if the hardrive wasn't there at the first place?

i think that won't matter considering the possibilities of juicing revenue out of this.

to start with, we can have prediction markets on 'polymarket' today where a rolling 3-6 monthly market can be run.

i can myself launch 'dcds' risk markets around excavation (insurance derivatives) on my live product 'autonomint'.

there could be 'media + story monetization' as this is a netflix special waiting to happen

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum etfs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven‚Äôt started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it‚Äôs interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it‚Äôs important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it‚Äôs mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including defi and nft trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders‚Äîadding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you‚Äôre following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

i can remember, not long ago people were still second-guessing everything. the whole mood was stuck in ‚Äúwait and see.‚Äù while a lot of folks probably stayed on the sidelines or cut risk thinking more downside was still coming. and now it‚Äôs like the momentum just picked up without giving anyone a clean signal.  
  
this is usually how it goes though. the market rarely makes a big announcement before moving. things just start shifting, slow at first, then all at once, and by the time people start noticing, most of the early part of the move is already in. and that is what makes it hard. not just the timing but the patience. the ability to stay exposed even when it feels like nothing is happening, or worse, when it feels like everything might fall apart. situations like this always bring things like dca into people‚Äôs minds. not because it‚Äôs smart or strategic or any of that, but because it lets them stay in motion without having to solve the whole market puzzle every time. no need to know if it‚Äôs the bottom or not. just bit by bit, and let the averages do their thing over time. it‚Äôs not exciting but it keeps you from getting stuck in that cycle of trying to catch the perfect moment and always missing it.

* low liquidity
* no macro signals
* chop with no follow-through
* retail gets baited early, loses edge

sunday and monday flashed some price bumps-which triggered fomo for frothed up retail traders. but, as we discussed -those were bad moves to make.

so how do you actually beat the august traps this-and probably next week?

# playbook:

no long trades this week or next unless these macro-confirmation levels start to trigger:

* btc/usdt must break above $120k to prove strength
* usdt.d needs to fall below 4.34%-stablecoin exit = risk-on
* total3 must clear $1.115t to validate altcoin participation
* btc/usdt below $116k = invalidation zone (and it's there now)
* eth/btc above 0.0329 signals alt rotation, especially eth-led

traders keep reacting to surface level moves: green candles, volume spikes, sudden pumps. but in august? that‚Äôs the trap. no volume + no macro =no trend.

only price levels tied to dominance flows, total market cap shifts, and btc compression breakouts offer real edge.

want to survive august and more than likely come out booking a positive month? don‚Äôt guess. let confirmation come to you. these five levels are your filter. no triggers=no long trades.

not financial advice. do your own research.

2025-08-05 07:56:00+00:00,"a sad crypto story back in 2011, a programmer named stefan thomas made a short animated video called ‚Äúwhat is bitcoin?‚Äù just a simple explainer to help people understand this strange new digital currency. for his work, he was paid 7,002 bitcoins. at the time, that wasn't a big deal. bitcoin was worth just a few dollars, and no one really knew what it would become.

stefan, who believed in the technology, stored the coins on a secure usb drive called an ironkey. it was built for maximum security so secure, in fact, that if you forget the password, you only get ten chances to guess it before it locks forever. stefan wrote the password down on a slip of paper, then misplaced it.

fast forward a decade, and bitcoin has exploded in value. those 7,002 coins are now worth over $800 million. but stefan can‚Äôt get to them. he‚Äôs used eight out of his ten tries, and every wrong guess brings him closer to losing it all permanently.

he‚Äôs talked to security experts, cryptographers, even companies that specialize in data recovery. they all told him the same thing: there‚Äôs no way in. the encryption on the ironkey is practically impossible to crack. no reset button. no backup. no customer support to call.

stefan has spoken publicly about how he‚Äôs tried to make peace with the situation. he doesn‚Äôt dwell on it anymore, because what else can he do? it‚Äôs not about being careless or greedy. it‚Äôs just a painful reminder of how easy it is to lose something incredibly valuable,not because you lost the thing itself, but because you forgot the key to it.

his story has become legendary in the crypto world,a quiet warning about the risks of self-custody in a digital age. when your wealth is protected by a password, forgetting it can cost you everything.

in 2023, security researchers at unciphered claimed they found a way to bypass the ironkey's 10-attempt limit using advanced hardware techniques. they offered to help, but thomas declined, saying he had already made deals with other recovery teams. the bitcoin remains locked.

1. only 84 million max supply (scarce)

2. significance, one of the earliest crypto currencies to ever release. btc is first ever so it‚Äôs extremely significant. but ltc also holds a lot of significance being one of the earliest coins ever. (significant)

3. ltc is considered silver to btc gold, they should be considered like a married couple. 

4. only an $8-$9 billion market cap, extremely undervalued in my truly honest opinion considering it being such an early adopted coin for many years. the price spread between btc and ltc is severely lopsided and i believe ltc will eventually close the gap as a supply shock will happen at some point and many people racing to own a piece of ltc.

5. demand is picking up, new developments will come, big companies and institutions will add this to their portfolios. 

6. nasdaq has them on the list for the etf they just signed the other day. 

7. extreme amount of upside potential for $ltc considering all of these factors!

2025-08-03 19:24:02+00:00,"""tax-free crypto"" isn't what you think, here's what these 5 countries actually offer and why most people can't use them everyone's sharing those ""move to portugal for zero crypto tax"" posts but let me break down what ""tax-free crypto"" actually means in these places. spoiler: it's way more complicated than the headlines suggest.

the reality check: most of these ""tax-free"" jurisdictions have massive catches that nobody talks about. here's what each actually offers:

uae/cayman islands: true zero tax on everything crypto-related. but you need to physically live there and meet residency requirements. uae is expensive as hell ($3k+/month minimum) and cayman islands cost of living will destroy your gains anyway.

germany: only tax-free if you hold for 12+ months. short-term trades get hammered with regular income tax rates (up to 45%). this isn't a trading paradise - it's a hodler's bonus.

portugal: used to be amazing, now it's complicated. long-term gains (365+ days) are still exempt, but short-term is 28%. the nhr program that made it attractive basically ended in march 2025. you missed the boat.

el salvador: zero tax on bitcoin specifically, but good luck actually living there. infrastructure is rough and you're betting on a country that's negotiating with the imf about their bitcoin experiment.

what nobody tells you:

you need actual tax residency, not just a visa

most countries will still tax you on worldwide income if you're a citizen

moving costs, visa fees, and compliance costs eat into savings

tax laws change fast (portugal just proved this)

us citizens get fucked regardless due to citizenship-based taxation

the harsh truth: these aren't magical loopholes for your $10k portfolio. they're legitimate options for people with serious money who can afford to actually relocate and maintain compliance.

if you're making less than $500k annually from crypto, the costs of relocating properly probably outweigh the tax savings. plus you're trading away access to your home country's financial system, healthcare, and social networks.

for most people, the real ""tax optimization"" is:

hold long-term to get capital gains rates

use tax-loss harvesting

consider retirement accounts where possible

actually track your transactions properly

actually track your transactions properly with tools like awaken.tax

the crypto tax game isn't about finding some exotic jurisdiction to escape to. it's about understanding your local tax code and playing within the rules smartly.

anyone actually made the move to one of these places? or are we all just fantasizing about tax-free gains while sitting in our high-tax home countries?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mgrzyy/taxfree_crypto_isnt_what_you_think_heres_what/,29,11,1mgrzyy,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9772
2025-08-03 16:58:22+00:00,"what if bitcoin stay at 120k and altseason kick in ? i‚Äôm expecting ethereum to hit around $10k (give or take) by some time in the future. one way to know eth‚Äôs strength is through the eth/btc ratio, because bitcoin is basically the standard in crypto. it's like the measuring stick for the whole market.

when the eth/btc ratio goes up, it means the market is favoring ethereum over bitcoin. when it goes down, bitcoin‚Äôs leading the way. historically, this ratio has bounced between 0.018 and 0.09. so when eth is strong, 1 eth can be worth as much as 0.09 btc. when it's weak, it's closer to 0.018 btc.

i believe history tends to repeat itself, the details might change, but the ratio usually plays out the same.

so let‚Äôs say bitcoin hits $120,000 by year end, and we get another altcoin season like we saw in 2017 and 2021, pushing eth/btc ratio climbs to 0.09 again, that would put ethereum at:

0.09 x $120,000 = $10,800.

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,64,13,1mdhcve,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,-0.9481

in very early 2017 no one was expecting a massive alt rally. it happened because some people thought btc would be replaced with currency coins and there would be use for other more fancy projects. alts did rally in previous years to but not like 2017. the point being people were not expecting it at soon at btc best its 2013 high. altseason was a complete surprise.

in late 2020 alts got hammered (except eth) and btc rallied. people were selling alts into btc even when btc was well past its 2017 high. altseason came in january 2021 and many were surprised at the sudden move and came to the acceptance that we had altseason a few weeks into it.

2025-07-28 20:48:11+00:00,"btc dipped after getting shafted at $119k where's the momentum going? so we just watched btc drop to $117.9k today with $47.5 million getting liquidated, and honestly this whole $119k rejection is getting concerning. we've seen this level turn into a brick wall multiple times now and each attempt is getting weaker.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

novogratz isn't abandoning bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and galaxy holds 13,504 btc. but they're clearly making a calculated rotation into ethereum, now holding 64,858 eth as their second-largest position.

 while bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their btc purchases, ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. that's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.

companies like bitmine immersion with 566,766 eth and sharplink gaming with 360,807 eth are betting big on this model. ether machine is even going public on nasdaq with $1.5 billion committed to ethereum.

the numbers back up the sentiment too. ethereum etfs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during july while bitcoin etfs managed $827 million. blackrock's etha is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for eth exposure is accelerating.

what i find compelling is the yield component. bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in defi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. that's a different value proposition entirely.

while most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching bitcoin stay flat, eth spot etfs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. just on friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. and that is not random. someone is clearly building a position.

it‚Äôs not even evenly spread. blackrock‚Äôs etha brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. one fund. that‚Äôs not just a good day. that‚Äôs serious intent. etha now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. and that‚Äôs not some casual exposure either. its a major position.



after that bitwise and fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while grayscale‚Äôs ethe is still bleeding though. it lost another 23 million on friday. but even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across eth etfs stayed green. these says a lot. quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.

 it becomes clearer to me. since launch eth spot etfs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of eth‚Äôs total market cap. just on thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these etfs. so it‚Äôs not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.

here‚Äôs how i see it. it reminds me of how the btc etf flows started earlier this year. just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. eth hasn‚Äôt had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. and maybe that‚Äôs exactly why institutions are loading up now. the price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren‚Äôt even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. but when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast. and from what i‚Äôm seeing here this feels like the second one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9z73p/ethereum_etfs_now_hold_46_of_market_cap_with/,72,18,1m9z73p,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9232

2025-07-25 04:03:52+00:00,"the bitcoin bloodbath: why whales just set the stage for a monster rally. $btc falls to 116k in minutes! what the hell just happened?



if you watched bitcoin‚Äôs price action today, you might have felt a jolt of panic. a sudden, gut-wrenching plunge that sent the price tumbling and social media into a frenzy. it looked like a classic crypto crash‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt.



what you just witnessed was a masterclass in market manipulation, a strategic ‚Äúshakeout‚Äù orchestrated by the giants of the crypto world‚Äîthe whales. and if you understand their game, you‚Äôll see this bloodbath wasn‚Äôt an ending. it was a beginning. in fact, it's the clearest sign we have that a significant price spike is likely on the horizon.



1. the anatomy of a takedown

first, let‚Äôs break down what happened. this wasn‚Äôt random selling. it was a targeted strike. using sophisticated tools like liquidation heatmaps, large traders can see exactly where massive pools of ""leveraged long"" positions are sitting. these are essentially bets from smaller traders that the price will go up, but they've borrowed money to amplify their bet. it‚Äôs risky, and the whales know it.



this week, the heatmap was lit up like a christmas tree, showing billions of dollars in these leveraged positions just below the market price. it was a sitting duck. whales began to push the price down, just enough to hit the first of these liquidation zones.

what followed was a domino effect‚Äîa liquidation cascade.

when the first group of leveraged traders was wiped out, their positions were automatically sold, adding massive selling pressure. this pushed the price down further, hitting the next liquidation zone, and then the next. it was a controlled demolition, designed to do one thing: clear out the ""dumb money"" and create a clean slate.



2. the motive: a pre-emptive strike before the fed

so, why now? look at the calendar. next week, the u.s. federal reserve holds its fomc meeting, where it will make a crucial decision on interest rates. this is one of the most significant market-moving events of the year.

whales don't like uncertainty. the period before a fed announcement is filled with nervous energy and unpredictable swings. by triggering this liquidation cascade \*before\* the meeting, they achieve three brilliant strategic goals:



\-  they de-risk the market: by flushing out the over-leveraged and panicky traders, they stabilize the market on their terms, reducing the chaos that could ensue after the fed's announcement.



\-  they engineer a discount: this manufactured crash allows them to buy up huge amounts of bitcoin at a bargain price. while everyone else was panic-selling, they were quietly accumulating, loading their bags for the next leg up.



\-  they seize control of the narrative: a sharp drop creates fear. but for those who know what to look for, it signals opportunity. the whales have now set the stage to profit from the rebound they themselves will help create.



3. the grand finale: get ready for the spike

this brings us to the most exciting part. this aggressive, strategic takedown isn't a sign of a bear market. it's the prelude to a powerful rally. having cleared the board and filled their positions at a discount, the whales are now perfectly positioned for what comes next.

the consensus is growing that the federal reserve will signal a more ""dovish"" stance, opening the door for future interest rate cuts. such a move would be rocket fuel for risk assets like bitcoin.



with the over-leveraged players gone and the market reset, there's now very little resistance to the upside. the selling pressure has been artificially exhausted. the path of least resistance is now firmly upwards.

don‚Äôt be fooled by the red candles and the fearful headlines. the game is played in the shadows, and the whales just showed their hand. they‚Äôve cleared the path, taken their positions, and are ready for the next major move. this wasn't a crash. it was a launch sequence. buckle up.

think about it, if trump lays the foundations for bitcoin and crypto to go more mainstream, and under the guise of a legitimate but ""speculative"" investment asset class (meaning the blame is put on investors if they lose their money), then there is literally no way for his wlf associates to face any accountability in court. he will use the typical ""the risk is on the investor, and therefore no one is to blame if they lose their money"" excuse. 

this may not have been explained in the best way, but mark my words, that narcissistic grifter never does anything unless he can ""personally"" benefit from it.

2025-07-23 21:59:59+00:00,"white house dropping their crypto playbook july 30, what to expect? government just spent 6 months figuring out their crypto strategy and they're releasing it next week, what this could bring for anyone holding crypto or thinking about getting in.

good stuff: bitcoin reserve proposal - if the government starts holding bitcoin alongside their gold reserves, that would mean that btc has real value in us economical terms.

fed access for crypto companies - this is huge but boring. right now, crypto companies have to go through regular banks to move dollars around, which creates delays and extra costs. direct fed access means faster, cheaper transactions. better user experience, lower fees for us.

basically expect volatility around the announcement as markets love clarity. if this goes well, it removes a lot of regulatory overhang that's been suppressing prices. institutional adoption becomes easier when the rules are clear. one side benefit of clearer regulations is that tax compliance should get easier too. right now everyone's guessing at how to report crypto transactions, but solid regulatory framework means platforms like awaken.tax can build better tools knowing the rules won't change every six months. less regulatory confusion equals better user experience across the board.

the bottom line is that this feels like a turning point. either crypto gets the regulatory clarity it needs to explode, or we get buried under bureaucracy. the july 30 report won't give us all the answers, but it'll show us which direction we're headed.

i downloaded another trading app and pulled out my some money from spot account from different application and transferred those funds to my new application futures

- 91.8% of crypto users hold stablecoins

- 83% specifically hold usdt

- 43.5% fully trust tether

yet, despite the trust and popularity, actual usage remains surprisingly low:

- only 54.3% have ever made a crypto payment

- just 37% have used usdt in real-world scenarios (either online or offline)


the report suggests the problem isn‚Äôt technological but related to product, user experience, and real-world incentives.


i'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.

but honestly, looking at what‚Äôs happening across the board, i‚Äôm starting to wonder if we‚Äôre already *in the middle of it*, just in a more subtle form.

some signs that caught my attention:

**$sol broke above $200** recently, with strong momentum and bullish setups.

**$spk (spark)** is pumping post-airdrop, and its tvl just hit $8.15b ‚Äî an all-time high.

several solana memecoins are doing **3x‚Äì5x within days**.

and perhaps most surprisingly: **bitget‚Äôs new listings in july massively outperformed**.

‚Üí 1 token did a 10x 

‚Üí 6 tokens did over 3x 

‚Üí **average ath roi: \~279%**, with **\~99% still active** as of july 18.

i came across these stats from a tweet by [https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173](https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173), and honestly, i thought i was the only one noticing this kind of trend...

so here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm asking:

üëâ **are we already in a ‚Äúslow-burn altseason‚Äù** that most people are just ignoring?  
üëâ or is this just the warm-up before a true altseason blow-off top?  
üëâ is now the time to take profits or to hold and prepare for a second wave?
