2025-08-20 14:41:11+00:00,"ecc break probability? hey everyone, since there has been talk about quantum computers and all that i revisited in depth how btc encryption works. the weakpoint in btc system seem to be ecc (elliptic curve cryptography).

  
how would yall estimate the probbability of ecc cryptography being broken in the next 10 years? also accounting for the unknown unknowns like coming up with new tech/algorithms.  
  
ai (grok4) answer:  
""based on expert analyses from sources like hsbc, postquantum, and recent quantum research (as of 2025), the probability of ecc being broken in the next 10 years is estimated at 20-30%, factoring in quantum advances and unknown unknowns like unforeseen breakthroughs. if broken, btc's secp256k1 keys could be compromised, risking theft. the network would likely hard fork to quantum-resistant crypto like xmss or dilithium to secure funds.""

damn, 30% seems alot. i really hope somebody here will have a good counterargument why its not likely to happen soon (50+ years).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mvgowa/ecc_break_probability/,0,8,1mvgowa,reddit,Bitcoin

i'm not daring enough to claim it's the first magnetic board. however, i think it could be ""one of the first,"" as i haven't found one online.

it's the boards to attatch the green and red bars to update the in-game prices in real time.

its core concept is to survive against inflation and collect the most wealth points to be a winner.

we've hosted a big event in thailand to let people test the game with more than 200+ joining in. and the feedback is almost all positive.

it's on the less than 25 hours final kickstarter day to end the campaign, so you could check it out.
