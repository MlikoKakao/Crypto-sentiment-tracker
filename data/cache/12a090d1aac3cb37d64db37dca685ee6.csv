as a day trader however, this market is giving me opportunity after opportunity and scalping trades are working out perfectly and providing great profits! 

just want to put some positivity in these ""dark days"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1jzm5cp/i_love_this_market/,14,9,1jzm5cp,reddit,CryptoCurrencyTrading
