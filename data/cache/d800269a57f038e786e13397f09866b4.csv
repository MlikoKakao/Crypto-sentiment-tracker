2025-08-07 12:47:34,"validate my btc strat morning bitcoiners,

i was late to the game in 2023, and even then only bought a small amount. about a month ago found my ledger nano and found a few thousand dollars in there. between then and now have read up again and once the republicans passed the bill that increased the debt ceiling another 5 trillion and cut taxes on the rich i knew usd was fucked (also know all the stats about money printing, never stops).

i recently quit contributing 10% to my 401k, reduced it down to get full company match. i quit contributing to my ira also (this one i’d like advice on). i now have a dca strategy of $92/day which will give me roughly $33k/year in contributions to btc.

i get quarterly bonuses from my job (around $5k net) and i’m wondering what i should do with these lump sums of cash. when i don’t know what to do i at least park it in a high yield savings account. i obviously want my cost average to be as low as possible to just shoving in lump sums at high prices given btcs volatility seems like a novice move. maybe just increase dca amount? 

does anyone still do iras? i would do roth back door since i am phased out of normal roth contribution limits.

don’t want to be an idiot on tax free gains and compounding interest. switching to an hsa as well to get that triple tax benefit as well. i just want to be as smart as possible. i used to think diversification was the best tool, but diversify in fiat just makes me feel like i’m swimming upstream against my own conviction.

p.s. thanks to this forum i found out that ledger is a piece of shit and i have already ordered a coldcard q. love this community for always looking out for each other, providing great information, and the occasional dogging because the shit is hilarious.

2025-08-07 14:51:29,"a deep dive into qrl: the quantum-safe blockchain quantum computing is no longer science fiction — it’s progressing fast. and with it comes a very real threat to the cryptography that underpins nearly every blockchain in existence.  
  
so… if quantum risk is inevitable, where do you place your bet? and is $qrl the most credible hedge in the entire crypto space? let’s break it down.  


**my discovery of quantum resistant crypto**

i’ve been interested in quantum computing for years, even investing in quantum tech etfs recently. it was clear that fields like medicine and energy would benefit from quantum — but then i started wondering about crypto. if quantum computers can break encryption that traditional systems can’t, what does that mean for bitcoin, ethereum, and the rest?  
  
i quickly learned that ecdsa, used to secure most blockchains, is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks. at first, i assumed the fix would be simple — just upgrade the cryptography. but once i dug deeper, it became clear that upgrading legacy chains would be a slow, messy process requiring global coordination.  
that led me to explore projects focused on quantum security from the start. i found a few — qrl, qanx, and cell — and eventually concluded that qrl is the most credible bet in my opinion. it’s a purpose-built blockchain using xmss at the protocol level, and the community is focused, technical, and refreshingly hype-free.  


**qrl is built different: quantum security at the core**

while most blockchains still rely on outdated signature schemes like ecdsa, qrl has used xmss — a hash-based, quantum-resistant signature algorithm — from the start. this means it doesn’t just talk about post-quantum security. it runs on it.  
  
xmss is secure against quantum attacks and doesn’t rely on factorization or elliptic curves — the very structures quantum computers are expected to break. unlike the “future upgrade paths” of legacy chains, qrl’s cryptography is already designed for a quantum world.  
  
and it gets better.  
  
with the upcoming zond platform (qrl 2.0), qrl will introduce support for sphincs+, a stateless, hash-based signature scheme recently selected for global standardization. this adds even more flexibility and resilience to qrl’s architecture, giving developers the option to choose between multiple quantum-safe primitives — all without compromising on-chain security. after the update, existing wallets remain quantum-secure and can be upgraded to the new format at any time.  


**born too early**

let’s rewind to 2018. qrl launched its mainnet. it never gained much traction in the altcoin scene and flew under the radar for years.  
  
why?

* the 2018 bear market nuked everything
* quantum risk felt 20 years away
* no smart contracts, no defi ecosystem
* devs stayed heads-down, no vc or pr push
* very limited exchange listings
* bittrex listing was a hard lesson learned

basically: wrong timing, right idea.  


**the world is catching up**

quantum computing is no longer theoretical. it’s real, it’s advancing fast, and it’s now hitting headlines that matter:

big tech is all-in: ibm, google, and many quantum specific companies such as ionq, rigetti etc. — all scaling up quantum hardware year over year with massive investments.

white house warning (july 2025): quantum computers could ""derive any digital asset holder’s private key from their public key."" and ""some experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge in the next five to ten years.""

blackrock (may 2025): etf filings flagged quantum as a direct risk to bitcoin. 

elon musk asked grok (august 2025) if quantum computers could crack sha-256. grok's answer was that sha-256 might be okay for a while. however, elon didn't ask about ecdsa which is the lowest hanging fruit for quantum computer and biggest risk currently. deloitte estimates \~25% of bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum theft due to exposed public keys.

ecdsa — the digital signature algorithm used by bitcoin, ethereum, and most wallets — is exactly what shor’s algorithm breaks. and it breaks it fast.

forbes and wsj writing about quantum threats: 

* forbes: ""the quantum threat to encryption: how businesses can future-proof""
* wsj: ""here’s how quantum computing could change the world"". ""quantum has so often been spoken about as something that was always coming in the next five or 10 years,” kohler said. “the conversations are changing dramatically because it’s now no longer 10 years down the road. it’s much closer.”



**why legacy chains can’t just “upgrade”**

many assume bitcoin or ethereum will just “switch to quantum-safe” one day.  
here’s the problem:

* protocol-level changes require global coordination
* you’d need consensus from miners, validators, exchanges, and users
* every old wallet and smart contract would need to migrate
* abandoned keys could be stolen forever
* it’s not just a software upgrade — it’s a political nightmare.

even partial fixes (like signature overlays or hybrid key pairs) won’t solve the root issue. once quantum hits, it’s not patchable — it’s a chain-wide vulnerability.  
  
bitcoin developer hunter beast discusses about the topic in the bitcoin rails podcast ""make bitcoin quantum resistant - with hunter beast"".  


**centralized systems are already preparing**

meanwhile, financial institutions are already preparing for the quantum threat. unlike decentralized blockchains, banks and centralized platforms can implement post-quantum algorithms more easily, thanks to centralized control, layered security, and fast upgrade cycles.  
  
they don’t need global consensus or to rescue abandoned wallets. they can simply roll out post-quantum security behind closed doors. the hard truth? legacy blockchains are structurally less agile when it comes to cryptographic overhauls.  


**state-level threats: quiet and strategic**

the real quantum threat may not come from hackers — but from nation-states with the budget, motive, and secrecy to act before the world catches up.

***what could they do?***

* silently drain dormant wallets with exposed public keys
* decrypt sensitive communications, from top-secret memos to financial data
* harvest encrypted traffic now, and decrypt it later with quantum power

***why it won’t be obvious***

governments wouldn’t use quantum to collapse bitcoin — especially if they’ve already restricted it domestically. instead, they’d act quietly and selectively, exploiting vulnerabilities without shaking the system.  
  
the threat isn’t chaos. it’s control — and they won’t announce when they get it.  
  
during a recent u.s. congressional oversight hearing, it was noted that:  
***“we don’t even know the names of quantum computing companies in china.""***  
— fabaiquantum, jul 1, 2025 on x  
  
the united states office of management and budget has drafted a memorandum that directs federal agencies to fully migrate to a post-quantum cryptographic standard:   
***""everything must migrate to post-quantum cryptography, cryptocurrencies included.""***  
— qdayclock, jul 17, 2025 on x



**limited listings — for now**

qrl is currently listed on just a few smaller exchanges like mexc, banxa and lbank. daily volume is low, and there’s no tier-1 listing yet. it's possible to acquire qrl but takes an extra effort.  
  
a future binance or coinbase listing would dramatically increase visibility, liquidity, and credibility. as quantum security gains attention from regulators and institutions, tier-1 exchanges may start favoring post-quantum assets — and qrl is one of the few ready now.



**community recap**

despite being one of the most technically sound projects in crypto, qrl has flown under the radar for years — and so has its community. there’s no influencer campaigns, and no hype cycles driving engagement. just a small but growing base of long-term holders, technologists, and security-minded crypto users.

* the qrl subreddit remains active with updates, research, and user-led discussions.
* devs regularly publish progress on github and engage with the community through blog posts and discord.
* the team has stayed focused on delivery — not marketing.

what you’ll find here isn’t noise — it’s signal. the community is small, but conviction is high. and as quantum awareness grows, those watching qrl now may be the earliest of the early.  


**my path to qrl owner**

after doing my due diligence about qrl, what has really convinced me was project zond (qrl 2.0). if it succeeds, developers could migrate ethereum-style smart contracts to a quantum-safe layer with minimal changes. that could be a turning point — both for qrl adoption and visibility. i believe a tier 1 listing and real marketing push could follow. so i bought in early — before the headlines hit.

to be honest, the restricted market access for qrl was almost a deal-breaker. but i believed the project had real potential, so i opened a mexc account (which seemed like a good option from europe). despite the mixed reviews, everything worked smoothly in my experience.  
  
i was able to make a fiat transfer, convert eur to usdt, buy qrl, and withdraw it to my ledger after installing the qrl app. it took a bit of extra effort — but no issues at all.

my investment horizon is 3–10+ years. by then, it’s likely that q-day has happened — and it’ll be interesting to see where qrl stands. i believe the first truly quantum-resistant blockchain will have survived the turbulence and likely attracted many crypto holders looking to protect their assets. time will tell.  


  
**tl;dr**

* qrl was too early in 2018. now it might be right on time.
* quantum computing is accelerating
* legacy chains are structurally hard to upgrade
* qrl runs quantum-safe cryptography right now
* zond adds future-ready flexibility
* institutional attention is growing
* and almost no one’s looking — yet

2025-08-07 16:42:13,"when markets start moving without you the way markets are moving today makes me think. bitcoin, altcoins, and stocks have been climbing again, and now even china’s a-shares are starting to flip into a proper bull mood. everything seems to be rising at once. not just the prices, but everything around.  
  
i can remember, not long ago people were still second-guessing everything. the whole mood was stuck in “wait and see.” while a lot of folks probably stayed on the sidelines or cut risk thinking more downside was still coming. and now it’s like the momentum just picked up without giving anyone a clean signal.  
  
this is usually how it goes though. the market rarely makes a big announcement before moving. things just start shifting, slow at first, then all at once, and by the time people start noticing, most of the early part of the move is already in. and that is what makes it hard. not just the timing but the patience. the ability to stay exposed even when it feels like nothing is happening, or worse, when it feels like everything might fall apart. situations like this always bring things like dca into people’s minds. not because it’s smart or strategic or any of that, but because it lets them stay in motion without having to solve the whole market puzzle every time. no need to know if it’s the bottom or not. just bit by bit, and let the averages do their thing over time. it’s not exciting but it keeps you from getting stuck in that cycle of trying to catch the perfect moment and always missing it.  
  
and then when things finally move, like now, you’re already there. you’re not chasing, you are part of it. it’s wild how often the big days come when people are least ready for them. but i guess that is the point. the market moves when it wants, not when people feel confident.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mk53ol/when_markets_start_moving_without_you/,CryptoMarkets,5,8,1mk53ol,reddit,-0.677,116273.87314715952

the backlash was insane - those people are delusional. people calling me stupid, a conspiracy theorist, insult after insult.

what's wrong with people over there? its no secret why greece defaulted on their loan. all the information is publicly available. and an immutable financial ledger would have absoluty prevented the situation from occurring.

2025-08-07 18:06:01,"trump to open the door for crypto in 401(k)s...the realistic analysis so there’s talk about trump planning to sign an executive order to open 401(k)s to crypto, real estate, and private equity although as of now, it’s not signed.

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum etfs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven’t started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it’s interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it’s important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it’s mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including defi and nft trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders—adding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you’re following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

note: i repeat trump has not signed the 401(k) crypto order yet. the current market attention is based on potential outcomes, not confirmed events. monitor the situation, but don’t expect retirement funds to start moving into crypto soon. patience is necessary here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mk7cth/trump_to_open_the_door_for_crypto_in_401ksthe/,CryptoMarkets,54,27,1mk7cth,reddit,0.7538,116486.99012273956

2025-08-07 19:03:31,"does tokenizing the newport landfill makes sense? james howells, an it worker from south wales, had used his laptop to 'mine' \~ 8000 units of digital bitcoin currency in 2009. he was the one of only 5 miners in 2009. in 2010, the dell xps n1710 broke after he spilt lemonade on it, so he dismantled the computer  for parts, kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it.

that hardrive is now sitting at newport landfill somewhere buried under 25,000 cubic meters of waste and earth"", weighing approximately 110,000–200,000 tonnes. to give you the scale, it could be anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch.

now, as per the latest news, the landfill site is set to permanently close in the 2025/26 financial year. the landfill has been in operation since the early 2000s and is nearing the end of its lifespan, hence the council is planning its closure. it will mean a loss of a predicted sum of just shy of £1m for newport city council due to loss of revenes from disposal of commercial waste.

i feel that this presents a perfect opportunity to tokenize this landfill. the land can be leased for 5 years.  
now before tokenizing, would the hardrive be intact today or would have been galvanized ?  
howells believes the drive is still functional due to its protective casing and the anti-corrosive cobalt layer coating the glass disk.

britian isn't dubai or japan, so tokenizing direct 'landfill' might be difficult.

so, instead, we tokenized fund that will hold the lease to the landfill for next 5 years.  
that means:  
\- spvs.  
\- legal wrappers.  
\- some regulatory layers.  
\- miscellaneous costs

setting up tokenomics

total tokens - 21 million  
10% tokens held by james howells and the fund.  
out of the remaining 90% tokens, half i.e. 9.45 million tokens sold over public market at $1.05 thus netting $10 mln to take care of the operational cost.  
we can add vesting schedules if we want to.  
the remaining 50% tokens will be sold if bitcoin is found  
in the form of bitcoin treasury allocation.

the 8000 bitcoin is valued at \~ $950 mln today.

if you consider a rise of even 2x in bitcoin from here by next year then that's 20000% returns

using $10 mln raised funds

1. use of artificial intelligence using a mechanical arm to scan waste to identify the hard drive
2. using drones, and boston dynamics robotic dogs for security, 
3. 3.recruiting an ai specialist and an environmental team to the project.
4. experts in landfill excavation, and a data recovery advisor.

or, develop a community-owned mining facility on the landfill site. the facility would use solar or wind power and generate power revenues.

what if the hardrive wasn't there at the first place?

i think that won't matter considering the possibilities of juicing revenue out of this.

to start with, we can have prediction markets on 'polymarket' today where a rolling 3-6 monthly market can be run.

i can myself launch 'dcds' risk markets around excavation (insurance derivatives) on my live product 'autonomint'.

there could be 'media + story monetization' as this is a netflix special waiting to happen  
share revenue from:  
\-> netflix/youtube/prime rights  
\-> merch sales (“8000btc lost club”)  
\-> podcast sponsorships

time locked token vaults  
let’s say there’s an 5-year chance this pays off so build a lock-to-earn model:  
\-> stake tokens in a vault that matures only in 2030.  
\-> the earlier you lock, the bigger your cut of the find (or prediction market winnings).

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

2025-08-08 01:50:12,"i'm building a new project can you please let me know if this information is 100% correct? i'm building a project where you can track [**how many bitcoins are left.** ](https://bitcoinleft.com)  


# what happens when 100% of bitcoin is mined?

once the full 21 million btc are mined (estimated around year 2140), no new bitcoins will be issued. miners will be compensated solely through transaction fees. the supply becomes perfectly fixed, and issuance (block subsidy) drops to zero, leaving fees to incentivize security and transaction processing.

# who is satoshi nakamoto?

satoshi nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, who published the whitepaper in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. satoshi collaborated publicly for about two years and then stepped back in 2010–2011. their identity remains unknown.

# why could bitcoin’s price go up?

bitcoin has a fixed supply (21m), predictable issuance, and growing adoption. as demand increases against a capped supply, basic supply-and-demand dynamics can push price higher. network effects, institutional adoption (e.g., etfs), and halvings reducing new supply can amplify this. not financial advice.

# what is a halving?

approximately every 210,000 blocks (\~4 years), the block subsidy (new btc issued per block) halves. this reduces new supply entering the market and historically has been associated with multi-year market cycles.

# what are satoshis (sats)?

satoshis are the smallest unit of bitcoin. 1 btc = 100,000,000 sats. many wallets and services display values in sats for precision and usability.

# how is the network secured after 2140?

after block subsidies end, miners earn transaction fees from users. as usage grows, fee revenue is expected to sustain mining and network security.

# is bitcoin energy wasteful?

bitcoin uses proof-of-work, which consumes energy to secure the network. mining often seeks the lowest-cost energy, incentivizing renewables and acting as a flexible load that can stabilize grids and monetize stranded or curtailed energy.

the 4,000 mark is more than just a round number. it’s a psychological barrier for traders and a technical resistance level that has stopped eth multiple times in the past. break it with volume, and we could see momentum carry eth toward its previous ath and maybe beyond. fail to hold above 4k, and we might witness a sharp correction as over-leveraged positions unwind.

the current setup feels eerily similar to historical pre-breakout phases, where consolidation near a key level led to explosive upside. but the risk of a “fakeout” remains, especially if macro conditions or bitcoin price action turn against the market.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i got an idea to have some sort of insurance in the case i lose my coins, while still doing self custody. in the spirit of lose your keys, not your coins, i am thinking of building this service where all your utxos in your wallet have a special script that has a spending tree where there is a fallback where my service can trigger a transfer, which activates a dead man switch where the wallet holder can cancel the spending tree during 1 month time to assure some level of trust. 

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

2025-08-08 12:11:48,"hybrid seed backup idea: obfuscated bip39 + aes encryption — secure enough for personal use? 
hey folks,

i’m exploring a middle-ground approach to backing up a bip39 seed phrase that balances offline principles with practical storage and wanted to get your thoughts on the security model.



the idea (hybrid method):

never type the raw seed phrase anywhere digitally. 

only write it down on paper or metal initially. 

manually encode each word using a deterministic letter-shift cipher (e.g., convert letters to numbers, sum, reduce to single digit, shift each letter by that number — so added → jmmnm).

save only the encoded version (e.g., jmmnm hxzvn ljbqob ...) in a text file.

encrypt the encoded file using openssl aes-256-cbc with salt + pbkdf2 and a strong password:openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in encoded.txt -out seed.enc
store the encrypted file anywhere (email, cloud, usb, etc.).

decrypt + decode manually on paper only when recovery is needed.


why i like it:

raw seed is never typed, so no digital exposure.even if the encrypted file is leaked, it’s aes-256 protected.even if aes is broken or passphrase is compromised, the encoded content is non-obvious without knowing my logic.i can memorize or write down the obfuscation method separately (or keep it simple enough to remember).


questions for the community:

is this method secure enough for personal long-term storage if i’m disciplined?any attack vectors i might be overlooking?how does this compare to shamir’s secret sharing or metal backups?anyone else doing something similar?

i know this isn’t a replacement for true cryptographic key management, but i’m aiming for a secure-but-human-manageable compromise.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

dr. richard werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. he may not have said the word ""bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.  
  
every so often, a conversation slices through the static of our daily news cycle and strikes at the very foundation of our reality. it doesn't just present new facts; it provides a new lens through which to see the world, revealing that the chaos we experience isn't random but a product of a hidden design. tucker carlson's recent interview with dr. richard werner was one such moment.  
  
werner, a german economist with a quiet demeanor that belies the explosive nature of his work, has been labeled by some as “the most dangerous economist in the world.” why? his core thesis doesn't just challenge a specific policy or critique a political party. it dynamites the entire bedrock of modern banking and economics, exposing the system for what it is: a mechanism of control, engineered for specific outcomes.  
  
throughout the conversation, werner methodically dismantled the comforting lies we are told about money. the result was a chillingly clear picture of how inflation, perpetual war, and crushing inequality are not unfortunate byproducts of a complex system, but rather the intended output of its engine. and in doing so, whether he intended to or not, he erected the single greatest billboard for bitcoin imaginable. he described the disease in such perfect detail that the cure became self-evident.

the idea is it teaches you a bit about a bitcoin block while also being a fun little daily game.

with growing concerns over inflation, currency devaluation, and traditional markets showing signs of volatility, bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a reliable store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. for many companies, adding bitcoin to their balance sheets isn’t just about potential profits, it’s about future-proofing their assets in an unpredictable world.

this movement could mark the beginning of a new corporate gold rush, where bitcoin transitions from an alternative investment to a mainstream financial instrument. if you’ve been wondering why these companies are piling in now, this is it!

implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

if this theory will be proven right, it will reshape the world, hopefully for the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlg6xi/softwar_this_book_about_bitcoin_blew_me_away/,Bitcoin,274,73,1mlg6xi,reddit,-0.7031,116397.67926922366

* **current btc holdings**: enter how much btc you already own (e.g., 0.003 btc).
* **dca amount & frequency**: specify how much you’ll invest (e.g., $500) and how often (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
* **progress indicator**: displays a progress bar showing what percentage of 1 btc you’ve reached.

key features

* enter current btc balance, dca amount, and frequency
* calculates number of contributions needed 
* shows a progress bar toward 1 btc

feedback areas

* ui improvements (layout, colors, clarity)
* must-have metrics or charts (e.g., cumulative spend vs. btc acquired)
* feature ideas (scenario projections, notifications, tax estimates)
* preferred platform (web, mobile, browser extension, email bot)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlluod/built_a_bitcoin_accumulation_tracker_feedback/,Bitcoin,12,6,1mlluod,reddit,0.9493,117533.0938367717

2025-08-09 12:48:56,"question on bitcoin’s long-term security model i recently watched a video (will share in a comment) where the presenter made an interesting point: blockchains have to choose between *certainty of supply* and *certainty of security*. his argument was that a fixed supply means miner incentives could weaken over time, which could impact security. the alternative model he described was one where supply isn’t absolutely capped, but security is always reliably funded — and any supply growth could be offset by network usage (through mechanisms like fee burns).

i’m wondering what the bitcoin community thinks about this. is the current plan — relying on transaction fees alone — the best long-term approach for security, or do you see potential challenges?

a quadrillion?

that’s crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

rough esitmates say there’s only 2.4 billion us dollars - everything else is made up imaginary dollars and debt.

but if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it’s 50,000 times higher

and if there’s a sliding scale 

so that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

ridiculous.

in 2024:

* ⁠⁠public spending as a share of national income in the uk is slightly above the average of other industrial countries – the uk spends more than the us and japan, but much less than italy or france.⁠⁠
* ⁠⁠spending just above the international average, but raising less in revenue, leaves the uk running a budget deficit that’s above the industrial world average.⁠⁠
* ⁠⁠net debt in the uk is also higher than the average of other industrial countries.
* the uk government raised slightly more revenue relative to national income than the us, japan and australia, but less than germany and scandinavian countries like denmark and norway.

the budget deficit is expected to decrease over the next five years, with total receipts growing 27% primarily due to strategic tax policy changes, however given the current political climate, this may be hard to see translate to such a material change.

the national debt, although projected to increase in cash terms to £3.4 trillion by 2029-30, is expected to stabilize around 96.1% of national income.

**we expect public sector net debt to fall gradually from its peak of 96.6 per cent of national income in 2020-21 to 96.1 per cent of national income in 2029-30, which is equivalent to around £3.4 trillion or £116,000 per household.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlv6y9/a_uk_perspective_office_for_budget/,Bitcoin,9,3,1mlv6y9,reddit,-0.7717,116667.73371007523

since they have arrested the 5 people who participated in this attack it will be interesting to see if they were able to move the btc or not. if its still on the drive then there's a chance it can all be recovered! which would be a huge win.

**genius act**

·         **guiding and establishing national innovation for u.s. stablecoins**

·         **the first ever framework for stablecoin regulations**

·         **1:1 reserves required for united states $ dollar assets (hell yes, hopefully they audit usdt though lol)**

·         **the bank secrecy act now covers providers of stablecoin yasssss**

**clarity act**

·         **definition outlined for sftc and sec oversight of cryptocurrency**

·         **provides clarity for which digital assets are a commodity versus a security**

·         **trading platforms need to provide disclosure agreements or rules and to custody crypto**

**anti-cbdc surveillance state act**

* **federal reserve may not launch a cbdc central bank digital currency**
* **helps safeguard financial privacy and overreach by the government**

**these 3 bills provide a major shift of cryptocurrency from suspicion to adoption. yes, we always talk about mass adoption and here we are folks, the future of cryptocurrency 1 step at a time!**

**now it’s been a few weeks since crypto week and since the bills have passed. how are the effects of crypto week thus far?**

**cryptocurrency markets surging! ethereum headed towards ath with bitcoin maintaining structure. institutions are heavily investing in cryptocurrencies and stablecoins! operation choke point 2.0 has halted, allowing cryptocurrency services to access services provided by banks. regulators are working with banks to define rules for stablecoin creation and custody! executive order was signed by willy wonka to let cryptocurrency be investable through 401k plans, super awesome! irs is trying to make the tax process for cryptocurrency simpler, hopefully no more having to use services to go through all of my transactions each year haha.**

**with crypto week and it’s effects, we have an amazing positive outlook for cryptocurrency, especially in the united states. hopefully this momentum continues for years and into the future beyond infinity. thank you to all of the early adopters leading to this historic moment towards mass adoption, we have succeeded. however, it is still early so newcomers shouldn’t feel they have come into the space late! it’s like the dot com boom, but this time it’s different. cryptocurrency is here to stay.**

2025-08-10 06:10:33,"binance index linked, dca strategy and investment diversification does anyone use the binance index linked dca strategy? is it wise to invest this way, or do you have a better suggestion?

i have been investing since the beginning of 2024, the same amount in dollars every week. so far, i have only increased the amount i invest once.

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.
how should i best allocate the money? where should i open accounts? which platforms do you use and why? is it better to have everything in one place, or split between multiple brokers/platforms?
