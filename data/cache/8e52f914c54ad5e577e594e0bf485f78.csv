after actively courting industry support during his campaign, trump has wasted no time in delivering on his promises. key developments include:

✅ **a strategic bitcoin reserve** – the administration has announced plans to accumulate btc, signaling a shift in how the u.s. treats the asset.  
✅ **the first-ever white house crypto summit** – bringing together industry leaders and policymakers to discuss regulation and adoption.  
✅ **tariffs on major economies** – new trade tariffs on countries like canada and china have sparked controversy, but some argue they indirectly benefit bitcoin by increasing demand for non-sovereign assets.

target: $165.00  
r:r: 2.69:1  
potential gain: 11.86%  
potential loss: 4.41%  
trade type: swing

# this sol setup caught my attention due to a classic accumulation structure forming just above key weekly support. the trade was triggered at $147.50 following a measured pullback to the 1h ma50 — a level that's consistently acted as dynamic support over the last few weeks.

key confluence:

* **weekly**: price is holding above the $140–$143 base, with the 200ma flattening — signalling potential trend exhaustion rather than continuation down.
* **daily**: buyers have consistently defended the $141–$143 zone, giving confidence that this is more than just a dead-cat bounce.
* **4h**: higher lows are forming. structure looks to be shifting from bearish to neutral-bullish.
* **rsi** across timeframes is stable (not oversold), suggesting controlled consolidation — not panic selling.
* **volume** has remained steady during the range, supporting an accumulation narrative.

this is a swing, not a scalp. i'm giving this room to work, provided the structure holds. the invalidation point is clear — any breakdown through $141 and this trade thesis fails.

# profit management

i’m using a staged exit to lock in gains progressively and ride any extended move:

* **tp1** (50%): $156.00 – first resistance, locking in profits and reducing risk.
* **tp2** (30%): $165.00 – main target based on the width of the consolidation range.
* **tp3** (20%): $175.00 – extended target into weekly resistance zone. would need clean breakout + volume.

# key price levels

* **pivot**: $150.30
* **support zones**: $141.5 / $143.0 / $147.5
* **4h levels**: support – 143.02 / 147.51, resistance – 158.27 / 167.50
* **daily resistance**: 167.50 / 175.43

# risk factors to monitor

* a decisive break below $141 would invalidate the setup.
* sol typically follows btc on major moves — if bitcoin tanks, expect sol to follow.
* watch general crypto market sentiment. even clean technicals won’t hold up in a widespread sell-off.
* volume is key — need to see increasing buy volume on the push toward $156+ to confirm breakout strength.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1lecxwr/solusd_12_swing_trade_setup_triggered_overnight/,2,1,1lecxwr,reddit,CryptoCurrencyTrading,btc,en,0.9867

hope you're all having a solid trading day! just wanted to share what i'm seeing with btcusd right now and get some of your seasoned takes.

looking at my chart (it's a 15-minute timeframe for clear price action), bitcoin had a bit of a reset overnight, testing what looks like a pretty robust support level around the 108,400 mark. from that point, the buyers stepped in aggressively.

we've seen a really strong push upwards, decisively breaking out of what was a prior consolidation range/resistance zone (roughly 108,700-108,800). the current momentum is undeniable, and the candle formations are looking pretty healthy for the bulls.

my bias here is bullish, given the clean break and follow-through. i entered a couple of long positions earlier today, one at 108,634.84 and another at 108,642.04. both are sitting in decent profit right now, which is always nice! my eyes are set on a target around 110,478.61, riding this current upward wave.

what are your technical observations on this move? are you seeing strong volume confirming the breakout? any key resistance levels you're watching further up? always great to hear diverse perspectives on the market structure.

2025-07-09 14:19:41,"tesla could've made $17 billion by holding bitcoin. instead, they flinched. if they had accepted just 2% of car sales in btc since 2021 and held onto it, they'd now have around 160,000 btc - worth over $17b today. that's not a random stat. that's nearly half of tesla's total profit over the last 4 years.

but in may 2021, they stopped accepting bitcoin. claimed environmental concerns. btc dropped \~40% in days, and just like that - tesla was out.

it's easy to point fingers, but there's a bigger takeaway here:

bitcoin rewards conviction. not perfection. not timing. just conviction. if you treat btc like a trade, you'll always get shaken out. if you treat it like an asset - something to hold, protect, and build around - it will change your life.

look at how the wealthy treat real estate: buy it. hold it. let it appreciate. borrow against it. never sell. you don't sell the house because the market cools off for a year. you wait - and it pays.

bitcoin is no different. it's scarce, it's global, and over time, it's proven to outlast the noise. so yeah - tesla missed out. but the lesson stands:

don't fade on bitcoin. stack more. treat it like wealth. use it like the rich use their assets. and let time do the heavy lifting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lvjzw5/tesla_couldve_made_17_billion_by_holding_bitcoin/,62,39,1lvjzw5,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9961

the best advocates are willing to have the tough conversations. 

the risk to existing cryptography is a problem and he outlines why it is even more of a problem for bitcoin. 

 ""we’ll have to come to consensus on these half a dozen things simultaneously, which is pretty much unprecedented. given the slowing and the increasing difficulty and consensus changes to the bitcoin protocol, this is why i started talking about it a year ago.""

and hence i've raised many of lopp's same points. 

it serves both btc and qanx to do so. certainly it highlights qanx was correct to include quantum resistance on its vision for enterprise blockchain. 

but it's also important for several reasons that bitcoin addresses this. tackling the issue head on prevents panic and removes this from being a ""fud"" topic.  keeping bitcoin strong helps the entire space.

 quantum computing news will continue to make headlines as it is a worldwide race. every approach is being developed, with multiple innovations

2025-07-12 23:08:21,"why altcoins underperform btc: imagine permanent sell limit orders let's do a thought experiment.

currently strategy holds \~3% of bitcoin supply. average purchase price is \~$70k. michael saylor says he plans to never sell bitcoin. also, 95% of total bitcoin supply is in circulation now - only \~5% left to be mined.

what would happen if saylor changes his mind and decides to start selling, say, up to 50% of his btc holdings at exactly $120k price (as an example)? you can imagine this as a **permanent sell limit order** with the price of $120k and enormous volume (1.5% of supply). of course, technically it doesn't look like that, but conceptually it's the same: every time the price goes to $120k, the big seller would arrive and drive it back down.  
**the price would likely not go past $120k for a while** \- because even when demand grows, mstr will always be there to sell some more of their bag at $120k.

**and now imagine** if strategy held not 3%, but 30% of bitcoin supply. average purchase price is not $70k, but $7k. and saylor's goal is to make money in short/medium term, so he's ready to sell every time the price goes up. heck, he could even sell when the price is stable or goes down - he would still make a lot of money on top of $7k cost basis. just need to not sell a lot at once, because that would scare retail investors.

could btc ever keep going up under such conditions?

**this is what happens with most altcoins**. it has nothing to do with the tech itself. the tech can be awesome, but the token ownership incentivizes early investors to sell whenever the demand grows, limiting the price growth potential. and that will continue to happen until they sell their big bags, which can be 50% of total token supply, or even more.

**what about memecoins?** don't they have a more fair token distribution? not really. they still have founders and early adopters - lucky people who got 1%+ of supply each for minimal prices. when the price goes 10x-100x and the token enters, say, top 100 of cmc - they will start to sell, limiting the price growth.

how can we identify altcoins that can outperform btc in the long run? there is no guarantee, but here are a few metrics that we can look at, and compare it with btc.

**1. % of supply in circulation.** every time a token unlock happens, early investors get the token for free -  so they will always be incentivized to sell, driving the price down. if the token has, say, <80% in circulation, we can't expect the price to outperform btc just because of this reason. btc has 95%.

**2. % of supply held by whales**. a whale in cmc terminology is a wallet that holds >1% of total token supply. so if this number is, say, higher than 10%, we can expect that whale to sell when demand grows, to make profit. for btc only 1.25% of total supply is controlled by whales.

**3. historical price action in btc.** there were big waves of retail demand for altcoins in the past. we can look at price of the token in btc, not usd. for most of altcoins, it has a clear pattern: there is a surge every few years, and then a slow drop. and the surges usually get lower, and drops get deeper. unless the tech makes a groundbreaking advancement and adoption explodes, we can expect the pattern to continue. and just to be clear, the adoption has to be bigger than the adoption for btc. because the whales holding 1%+ of supply will keep selling, so the demand needs to smash past that. it's much harder for altcoins than for btc just because there are typically much bigger whales in terms of % of supply held.

here is the analysis of top 20 coins (cmc data):

|rank|token|% supply in circulation|% supply held by whales|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1**|**btc**|**95**|**1.25**|

**so is there any reason to invest in altcoins at all?**

i think the tech has potential, but projects should be selected very carefully. i don't think it makes sense to invest in projects with <80% supply in circulation (unless you're a huge believer in the specific tech) or with >10% held by whales. however, there is one exception to the last point. it is possible that the project foundation controls the large portion of supply (e.g. eth, trx), but they can be trusted that they won't limit the price action by constantly selling. i think trx is the best example of this. justin sun controls \~70% of token supply, however apparently he makes the trx price action follow the btc price, so the trx graph in btc is quite stable since \~2020.

so even though trx does not outperform btc, at least it follows it. it's a rare exception for projects with large % of token supply controlled by whales. i think it's not a coincidence that sun was [giving advice](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/01/22/justin-sun-claims-he-can-take-ethereum-to-10000/) to eth foundation on how to keep the price up. and still, it does not guarantee that the whales won't dump their bags if adoption explodes and demand suddenly goes up. they might make sure the graph in btc stays consistent, and still sell the excess of supply - so retail investors still won't make more money than they could in btc.

please share your thoughts in comments, and feel free to recommend projects with good tokenomics and small % controlled by whales.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lydsai/why_altcoins_underperform_btc_imagine_permanent/,11,30,1lydsai,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9974

retail shorts get squeezed hard when prices move against them but retail longs can also get hit if whales start unloading or the market turns. either way retail traders will most likely end up on the losing side because they don’t have the same information or patience as the big players.

2025-07-16 12:02:23,"why moving significant crypto holdings into a bank account is more complex than it seems turning large amounts of crypto into fiat can be unexpectedly challenging, even for people with fully legitimate funds. this is especially true for early adopters who relied on numerous exchanges over the years, including some that have since shut down.

while some banks claim to be crypto-friendly, most remain highly cautious due to regulatory scrutiny and the historic association of digital assets with illicit activity. in practice, the real obstacle often isn’t converting coins to fiat it’s successfully depositing that fiat without having the account frozen or the transaction rejected outright.

several steps are critical if you want to avoid issues:

carefully documenting the complete history of your transactions and sources of funds, which can require records going back many years.

preparing a thorough audit trail covering all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved.

understanding that internal compliance reviews are often more demanding than clients expect, and sometimes even front-office staff don’t fully grasp the process.

without proper groundwork, people frequently encounter prolonged delays, repeated document requests, or outright refusals from banks.

another problem that catches many by surprise is that older wallets can be labeled as high risk simply because they were connected to platforms like mt. gox, btc-e, or cryptsy. forensic analysis tools (like scorechain) can assign elevated risk scores to this historical exposure, regardless of whether today’s funds are clean.

disclosure: i work in this area professionally (swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have seen these situations play out repeatedly.

has anyone here navigated this process successfully? i’d be interested to hear how your compliance reviews went.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m1aqse/why_moving_significant_crypto_holdings_into_a/,25,15,1m1aqse,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.7538

2025-07-16 12:11:06,"btc holding at $118, eth etf inflows again, thiel's buying eth. retail still hesitant? there's a steady shift happening, but a lot of people still don't seem to see it...

btc is holding above $118k. eth pushed past $3.1k. and eth spot etfs in the us have now recorded eight straight days of inflows - $192m on monday alone, with blackrock taking in $171m.

meanwhile, peter thiel just picked up a 9% stake in bitmine immersion technologies, a company building an eth treasury that now holds over 160k eth. sharplink just added another 6k eth this week, bringing their total to 312k. and the moscow exchange is set to launch a new eth etf fund next month tied to blackrock's product.

that's capital flowing in from multiple fronts - us, europe, even russia. big players are accumulating quietly, yet retail sentiment still feels muted. the same people who called eth undervalued at $2k are now calling $3.1k overbought. it's the same pattern every cycle.

from here, we probably grind higher while capital rotates. disbelief is fuel. as long as the inflows keep coming and retail stays on the sidelines, btc and eth likely keep moving - slowly, structurally, and underexposed.

my take on all of this - eth keeps grinding up while everyone's keeps waiting for a magical dip that's probably not coming. at some point this thing's going to rip and when it does - most will have already missed a golden opportunity and just fomo in. look closely and you'll see it's already happening, just not loud yet...",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m1ax8w/btc_holding_at_118_eth_etf_inflows_again_thiels/,95,51,1m1ax8w,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.3506
2025-07-16 13:45:08,"bitcoin hits $122k+ and the retail buzz still not as crazy as 2021. why? of course it could just be me but there has been a sense of normalization in btc’s rise to six figures even though its an all time high with 120k. i remember the previous runs and the cultural wave they had on retail interest doesn’t seem to exist as much.

however, it is not bad necessarily. the retail fomo and sm hype also acted as catalysts in previous runs. but the multiple boom cycles may have created a new boring normal to mainstream adoption. furthermore, financial twitter has shifted focus to ai stocks (nvidia, openai) and politics from btc as nvidia and other techs are riding the ai hype train. also, psychological aspects such as btc rise from 60k to 100k is less emotionally and attentively impactful as 1k to 20k. 

the institutional money flowing into bitcoin etfs and corporate treasuries has fundamentally altered the market dynamics too. tools like awaken.tax are becoming more relevant as traders move from speculative plays to actual portfolio management. when microstrategy or blackrock buys bitcoin, it doesn't create the same viral social media moments as retail investors discovering crypto for the first time. these institutional purchases happen quietly, methodically, without the memes and excitement that drove previous cycles. it's efficient but sterile - the kind of adoption we wanted but perhaps didn't expect would feel so... corporate.

as many of you know, bitcoin was born as a direct response to the 2008 financial crisis. its goal was to decentralize the financial system, remove intermediaries, and resist control from central banks and governments. this still remains the ideological core of bitcoin.

initially, it was dismissed as a scam, a bubble, or pure speculation. but as cracks formed in the traditional financial system, bitcoin gained relevance. today, it has institutional backing from etfs to blackrock, microstrategy, and even el salvador.

**8–10% of bitcoin’s total supply is now held by institutions, etfs, and governments.**

this creates a kind of **centralization of influence**, as these entities control large volumes and can significantly impact price action and market direction. in fact, bitcoin's price movements are increasingly affected by u.s. monetary policy and fed decisions. even interest rate changes now cause notable reactions simply because powerful institutional players are involved.

so here's my point:  
**if institutional adoption keeps growing and these players control more than 10% of the supply,** bitcoin may no longer operate in a truly decentralized way. its price behavior could increasingly resemble that of traditional financial assets dictated by macroeconomic decisions and institutional strategies. this would go against bitcoin’s original purpose as autonomous money.

i'm not saying that bitcoin is going to disappear as a value reserve. i mean: what mutates is the real market control and behavior as a financial asset linked to institutions.

what do you think?  
**am i wrong?**

i'm **not** saying bitcoin will disappear as a store of value.  
what i’m saying is this: **what’s changing is who actually controls the market and how it behaves potentially turning btc into a financial asset shaped by institutional forces**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m28a38/the_illusion_of_decentralization_are/,0,4,1m28a38,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9766

wurster initially revealed schwab’s plans to start spot crypto trading last november and reiterated the plans in the firm’s spring 2025 business update. at the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the us.

“our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that,” wurster said. 

in addition to trading services, wurster revealed that schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. he said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. this suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.

“stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “we will have a stablecoin at some point.”

the statement comes after the genius act,  which is meant to regulate stablecoins, was passed on thursday by the us house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m3cmt4/charles_schwab_to_launch_bitcoin_and_ethereum/,20,2,1m3cmt4,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9601

2025-07-19 21:29:11,"why solana might actually flip eth (and why it probably won't happen soon) look, the numbers don't lie. when you can do the same transaction on solana for cents instead of tens of dollars on ethereum, that's a massive advantage.. eth gas fees are a total pain. like, why pay a fortune for the same thing when sol does it quicker and for less? someone mentioned on one of the threads dropping $150 on a new erc20 memecoin launch and getting hit with $94 in gas fees. that’s nyts.when you're tracking all these transactions for tax reporting with tools like awaken.tax, those gas fees really add up and eat into your actual gains. solana's speed is also insane compared to eth. everything feels instant, and when you're trying to catch a quick trade or mint something, those seconds matter. the whole network just feels more responsive for actual usage.

but here's why eth isn't going anywhere anytime soon:-
the developer ecosystem is just massive. we're talking about thousands of developers who have spent years building on ethereum, creating tools, learning the ins and outs of smart contracts, building entire careers around it. that doesn't just disappear overnight.
all those dapps, defi protocols, nft marketplaces - they're not going to migrate easily. there's so much infrastructure built on ethereum that moving would be like rebuilding the entire internet from scratch.
if solana does flip ethereum, we're probably looking at 2028-2029 at the earliest. maybe longer. these things take time, and network effects are incredibly powerful in crypto. bitcoin is still #1 despite having way worse tech than newer chains, purely because it was first.

2025-07-20 18:57:29,"forget the blockchain trilemma: kaspa is unlocking new dimensions in crypto [https://i.imgur.com/yj69kfm.png](https://i.imgur.com/yj69kfm.png)

for a long time, the crypto community, as articulated by vitalik buterin, believed in the **blockchain trilemma**: the idea that achieving scalability, security, and decentralization together was impossible, forcing a trade-off. but what if there's a fourth critical element often overlooked: **sustainability**? many sacrificed decentralization with proof-of-stake, some compromised security and hindered speed with sharding, and others opted for layer 2 solutions.

let's find out how kaspa offers a much better balance than other projects, tackling not just the original three, but adding sustainability to the mix.

# 1. decentralization that works

kaspa launched 100% fair with no shady pre-mines, no vc handouts, and no insider deals. it is truly permissionless, relying on pure **proof-of-work** mining, meaning anyone can join and run a node. thanks to kaspa’s fast block times, solo mining is a thing - it's actually profitable, giving individuals a real shot without relying on mining pools. with kaspa, the power stays distributed. it’s the people's crypto, and always will be.

# 2. security at warp speed

thanks to its revolutionary **ghostdag** protocol, co-authored by computer scientist yonatan sompolinsky (whose work contributed to bitcoin through academic papers, and his ghost protocol was even used in ethereum), kaspa maintains incredible security. this means your transactions are confirmed with the highest level of trust. no more wondering if your funds are safe.

# 3. scalability unlocked

traditional blockchains are like a single-lane road, getting congested quickly. kaspa's **blockdag** technology is like building a multi-lane highway, allowing multiple blocks to be created and confirmed in parallel. this isn't some theoretical promise; kaspa is already handling thousands of transactions per second, blowing past networks like solana *without* resorting to tricks like inflated voting transactions to pump tps. we're talking real, uncompromised speed, with 10 blocks per second today and 100 bps coming!

for context, [kaspa ranks as the fastest layer 1 crypto](https://kaspahub.org/article/fastest-cryptocurrencies/) among top cryptocurrencies with current 100-millisecond block times.

# 4. sustainable for the long haul

unlike bitcoin, which faces ongoing debate around its 'tail emission' and future miner incentives, kaspa is fundamentally designed for long-term sustainability. its support for **pruned nodes** significantly lowers storage requirements, making it easier and more accessible for anyone to run a node. this, combined with its energy-efficient design and high transaction throughput, supports a future where transaction fees become a significant income stream, ensuring the network remains strong and decentralized for generations.

**kaspa isn't just a coin; it's a movement.** it's built by brilliant minds focused on creating a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and sustainable digital cash system. while the old guard is fighting over scraps, kaspa is quietly building the future of money.

don't be left behind. this is your chance to front-run the smart money.

stack. hold. tell everyone.

kaspa is the real deal.

# tldr:

kaspa's solves **blockchain quadrilemma** \- which includes sustainability, an aspect often avoided by most projects.

so far, no daily down reversal price action remains constructive, and the structure is still intact. we're consolidating, but the trend isn't broken.

hourly congestion = bullish wedge?

here’s where things get interesting:

the hourly charts show a clear congestion zone forming what looks like a bullish wedge. the pattern holds as long as we don’t break below 116k.

the setup:

breakout level: 119k–120k — watch for a clean move above this to confirm upside continuation

invalidation: break below 116k

this is a technically-driven trade setup, not financial advice. if you're actively trading btc or positioning into the next leg up, this might be the time to zoom in and track hourly resistance closely.

some signs that caught my attention:

**$sol broke above $200** recently, with strong momentum and bullish setups.

**$spk (spark)** is pumping post-airdrop, and its tvl just hit $8.15b — an all-time high.

several solana memecoins are doing **3x–5x within days**.

and perhaps most surprisingly: **bitget’s new listings in july massively outperformed**.

→ 1 token did a 10x 

→ 6 tokens did over 3x 

→ **average ath roi: \~279%**, with **\~99% still active** as of july 18.

i came across these stats from a tweet by [https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173](https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1947269763765248173), and honestly, i thought i was the only one noticing this kind of trend...

so here’s what i’m asking:

👉 **are we already in a “slow-burn altseason”** that most people are just ignoring?  
👉 or is this just the warm-up before a true altseason blow-off top?  
👉 is now the time to take profits or to hold and prepare for a second wave?

good stuff: bitcoin reserve proposal - if the government starts holding bitcoin alongside their gold reserves, that would mean that btc has real value in us economical terms.

fed access for crypto companies - this is huge but boring. right now, crypto companies have to go through regular banks to move dollars around, which creates delays and extra costs. direct fed access means faster, cheaper transactions. better user experience, lower fees for us.

basically expect volatility around the announcement as markets love clarity. if this goes well, it removes a lot of regulatory overhang that's been suppressing prices. institutional adoption becomes easier when the rules are clear. one side benefit of clearer regulations is that tax compliance should get easier too. right now everyone's guessing at how to report crypto transactions, but solid regulatory framework means platforms like awaken.tax can build better tools knowing the rules won't change every six months. less regulatory confusion equals better user experience across the board.

the bottom line is that this feels like a turning point. either crypto gets the regulatory clarity it needs to explode, or we get buried under bureaucracy. the july 30 report won't give us all the answers, but it'll show us which direction we're headed.

2025-07-25 04:03:52,"the bitcoin bloodbath: why whales just set the stage for a monster rally. $btc falls to 116k in minutes! what the hell just happened?



if you watched bitcoin’s price action today, you might have felt a jolt of panic. a sudden, gut-wrenching plunge that sent the price tumbling and social media into a frenzy. it looked like a classic crypto crash—but it wasn’t.



what you just witnessed was a masterclass in market manipulation, a strategic “shakeout” orchestrated by the giants of the crypto world—the whales. and if you understand their game, you’ll see this bloodbath wasn’t an ending. it was a beginning. in fact, it's the clearest sign we have that a significant price spike is likely on the horizon.



1. the anatomy of a takedown

first, let’s break down what happened. this wasn’t random selling. it was a targeted strike. using sophisticated tools like liquidation heatmaps, large traders can see exactly where massive pools of ""leveraged long"" positions are sitting. these are essentially bets from smaller traders that the price will go up, but they've borrowed money to amplify their bet. it’s risky, and the whales know it.



this week, the heatmap was lit up like a christmas tree, showing billions of dollars in these leveraged positions just below the market price. it was a sitting duck. whales began to push the price down, just enough to hit the first of these liquidation zones.

what followed was a domino effect—a liquidation cascade.

when the first group of leveraged traders was wiped out, their positions were automatically sold, adding massive selling pressure. this pushed the price down further, hitting the next liquidation zone, and then the next. it was a controlled demolition, designed to do one thing: clear out the ""dumb money"" and create a clean slate.



2. the motive: a pre-emptive strike before the fed

so, why now? look at the calendar. next week, the u.s. federal reserve holds its fomc meeting, where it will make a crucial decision on interest rates. this is one of the most significant market-moving events of the year.

whales don't like uncertainty. the period before a fed announcement is filled with nervous energy and unpredictable swings. by triggering this liquidation cascade \*before\* the meeting, they achieve three brilliant strategic goals:



\-  they de-risk the market: by flushing out the over-leveraged and panicky traders, they stabilize the market on their terms, reducing the chaos that could ensue after the fed's announcement.



\-  they engineer a discount: this manufactured crash allows them to buy up huge amounts of bitcoin at a bargain price. while everyone else was panic-selling, they were quietly accumulating, loading their bags for the next leg up.



\-  they seize control of the narrative: a sharp drop creates fear. but for those who know what to look for, it signals opportunity. the whales have now set the stage to profit from the rebound they themselves will help create.



3. the grand finale: get ready for the spike

this brings us to the most exciting part. this aggressive, strategic takedown isn't a sign of a bear market. it's the prelude to a powerful rally. having cleared the board and filled their positions at a discount, the whales are now perfectly positioned for what comes next.

the consensus is growing that the federal reserve will signal a more ""dovish"" stance, opening the door for future interest rate cuts. such a move would be rocket fuel for risk assets like bitcoin.



with the over-leveraged players gone and the market reset, there's now very little resistance to the upside. the selling pressure has been artificially exhausted. the path of least resistance is now firmly upwards.

don’t be fooled by the red candles and the fearful headlines. the game is played in the shadows, and the whales just showed their hand. they’ve cleared the path, taken their positions, and are ready for the next major move. this wasn't a crash. it was a launch sequence. buckle up.

back in the day, i saw all the confident predictions that ada could hit $5–$7 easily, even when market cap logic didn’t quite add up. i got back into crypto around 2022 and have since been through every theory out there:

while most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching bitcoin stay flat, eth spot etfs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. just on friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. and that is not random. someone is clearly building a position.

it’s not even evenly spread. blackrock’s etha brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. one fund. that’s not just a good day. that’s serious intent. etha now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. and that’s not some casual exposure either. its a major position.



after that bitwise and fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while grayscale’s ethe is still bleeding though. it lost another 23 million on friday. but even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across eth etfs stayed green. these says a lot. quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.

 it becomes clearer to me. since launch eth spot etfs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of eth’s total market cap. just on thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these etfs. so it’s not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.

here’s how i see it. it reminds me of how the btc etf flows started earlier this year. just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. eth hasn’t had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. and maybe that’s exactly why institutions are loading up now. the price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren’t even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. but when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast. and from what i’m seeing here this feels like the second one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9z73p/ethereum_etfs_now_hold_46_of_market_cap_with/,70,18,1m9z73p,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9232

been thinking about bitcoin's 21m cap differently in this context. it's mathematical scarcity in a world where governments can create unlimited money. the whole decentralized thing means it operates outside banking systems that could get wrecked if debt restructuring actually happens.

novogratz isn't abandoning bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and galaxy holds 13,504 btc. but they're clearly making a calculated rotation into ethereum, now holding 64,858 eth as their second-largest position.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

so today when we have btc or eth rallying many people proclaim altseason. 

maybe we need complete capitulation of alts before altseason?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdgtc0/how_can_there_be_an_altseason_if_people_are/,0,32,1mdgtc0,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9177
2025-07-30 20:21:13,"fed holds rates as expected but crypto markets already pricing in the boring outcome, here's what happens next so the fomc meeting wrapped up with exactly what everyone expected rates staying at current levels. no surprise cuts, no hawkish surprises, just powell doing his usual ""we're data dependent"" routine. but the crypto reaction (or lack thereof) tells us way more about where we're headed.

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,60,13,1mdhcve,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,-0.9481

2025-08-03 16:58:22,"what if bitcoin stay at 120k and altseason kick in ? i’m expecting ethereum to hit around $10k (give or take) by some time in the future. one way to know eth’s strength is through the eth/btc ratio, because bitcoin is basically the standard in crypto. it's like the measuring stick for the whole market.

when the eth/btc ratio goes up, it means the market is favoring ethereum over bitcoin. when it goes down, bitcoin’s leading the way. historically, this ratio has bounced between 0.018 and 0.09. so when eth is strong, 1 eth can be worth as much as 0.09 btc. when it's weak, it's closer to 0.018 btc.

i believe history tends to repeat itself, the details might change, but the ratio usually plays out the same.

so let’s say bitcoin hits $120,000 by year end, and we get another altcoin season like we saw in 2017 and 2021, pushing eth/btc ratio climbs to 0.09 again, that would put ethereum at:

0.09 x $120,000 = $10,800.

look up eth/btc !

2025-08-03 19:24:02,"""tax-free crypto"" isn't what you think, here's what these 5 countries actually offer and why most people can't use them everyone's sharing those ""move to portugal for zero crypto tax"" posts but let me break down what ""tax-free crypto"" actually means in these places. spoiler: it's way more complicated than the headlines suggest.

the reality check: most of these ""tax-free"" jurisdictions have massive catches that nobody talks about. here's what each actually offers:

uae/cayman islands: true zero tax on everything crypto-related. but you need to physically live there and meet residency requirements. uae is expensive as hell ($3k+/month minimum) and cayman islands cost of living will destroy your gains anyway.

germany: only tax-free if you hold for 12+ months. short-term trades get hammered with regular income tax rates (up to 45%). this isn't a trading paradise - it's a hodler's bonus.

portugal: used to be amazing, now it's complicated. long-term gains (365+ days) are still exempt, but short-term is 28%. the nhr program that made it attractive basically ended in march 2025. you missed the boat.

el salvador: zero tax on bitcoin specifically, but good luck actually living there. infrastructure is rough and you're betting on a country that's negotiating with the imf about their bitcoin experiment.

what nobody tells you:

you need actual tax residency, not just a visa

most countries will still tax you on worldwide income if you're a citizen

moving costs, visa fees, and compliance costs eat into savings

tax laws change fast (portugal just proved this)

us citizens get fucked regardless due to citizenship-based taxation

the harsh truth: these aren't magical loopholes for your $10k portfolio. they're legitimate options for people with serious money who can afford to actually relocate and maintain compliance.

if you're making less than $500k annually from crypto, the costs of relocating properly probably outweigh the tax savings. plus you're trading away access to your home country's financial system, healthcare, and social networks.

for most people, the real ""tax optimization"" is:

hold long-term to get capital gains rates

use tax-loss harvesting

consider retirement accounts where possible

actually track your transactions properly

actually track your transactions properly with tools like awaken.tax

the crypto tax game isn't about finding some exotic jurisdiction to escape to. it's about understanding your local tax code and playing within the rules smartly.

anyone actually made the move to one of these places? or are we all just fantasizing about tax-free gains while sitting in our high-tax home countries?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mgrzyy/taxfree_crypto_isnt_what_you_think_heres_what/,27,11,1mgrzyy,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9772

1. only 84 million max supply (scarce)

2. significance, one of the earliest crypto currencies to ever release. btc is first ever so it’s extremely significant. but ltc also holds a lot of significance being one of the earliest coins ever. (significant)

3. ltc is considered silver to btc gold, they should be considered like a married couple. 

4. only an $8-$9 billion market cap, extremely undervalued in my truly honest opinion considering it being such an early adopted coin for many years. the price spread between btc and ltc is severely lopsided and i believe ltc will eventually close the gap as a supply shock will happen at some point and many people racing to own a piece of ltc.

5. demand is picking up, new developments will come, big companies and institutions will add this to their portfolios. 

6. nasdaq has them on the list for the etf they just signed the other day. 

7. extreme amount of upside potential for $ltc considering all of these factors! 

lastly, the supply is very limited, so to those who act fast and get on board can thank me later as time goes as the supply shock occurs here with $ltc. why is btc so high in value right now, the supply shock and demand. just wait for ltc to get to this point. many can’t afford btc anymore, so what is next up, $ltc, get on it and think deeply about this post!

2025-08-05 07:56:00,"a sad crypto story back in 2011, a programmer named stefan thomas made a short animated video called “what is bitcoin?” just a simple explainer to help people understand this strange new digital currency. for his work, he was paid 7,002 bitcoins. at the time, that wasn't a big deal. bitcoin was worth just a few dollars, and no one really knew what it would become.

stefan, who believed in the technology, stored the coins on a secure usb drive called an ironkey. it was built for maximum security so secure, in fact, that if you forget the password, you only get ten chances to guess it before it locks forever. stefan wrote the password down on a slip of paper, then misplaced it.

fast forward a decade, and bitcoin has exploded in value. those 7,002 coins are now worth over $800 million. but stefan can’t get to them. he’s used eight out of his ten tries, and every wrong guess brings him closer to losing it all permanently.

he’s talked to security experts, cryptographers, even companies that specialize in data recovery. they all told him the same thing: there’s no way in. the encryption on the ironkey is practically impossible to crack. no reset button. no backup. no customer support to call.

stefan has spoken publicly about how he’s tried to make peace with the situation. he doesn’t dwell on it anymore, because what else can he do? it’s not about being careless or greedy. it’s just a painful reminder of how easy it is to lose something incredibly valuable,not because you lost the thing itself, but because you forgot the key to it.

his story has become legendary in the crypto world,a quiet warning about the risks of self-custody in a digital age. when your wealth is protected by a password, forgetting it can cost you everything.

in 2023, security researchers at unciphered claimed they found a way to bypass the ironkey's 10-attempt limit using advanced hardware techniques. they offered to help, but thomas declined, saying he had already made deals with other recovery teams. the bitcoin remains locked.

* low liquidity
* no macro signals
* chop with no follow-through
* retail gets baited early, loses edge

sunday and monday flashed some price bumps-which triggered fomo for frothed up retail traders. but, as we discussed -those were bad moves to make.

so how do you actually beat the august traps this-and probably next week?

# playbook:

no long trades this week or next unless these macro-confirmation levels start to trigger:

* btc/usdt must break above $120k to prove strength
* usdt.d needs to fall below 4.34%-stablecoin exit = risk-on
* total3 must clear $1.115t to validate altcoin participation
* btc/usdt below $116k = invalidation zone (and it's there now)
* eth/btc above 0.0329 signals alt rotation, especially eth-led

traders keep reacting to surface level moves: green candles, volume spikes, sudden pumps. but in august? that’s the trap. no volume + no macro =no trend.

only price levels tied to dominance flows, total market cap shifts, and btc compression breakouts offer real edge.

want to survive august and more than likely come out booking a positive month? don’t guess. let confirmation come to you. these five levels are your filter. no triggers=no long trades.

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ⚡",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9949

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the “talking points” for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: “bitcoin has no intrinsic value”. “bitcoins value is unreliable and subjective”. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, “*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop­erties that are valued by acting men.”*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of “intrinsic value”

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing. 

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.”[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok. 

the words ""intrinsic"" and “value” existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, “the philosophical definition is wrong and it’s not what intrinsic value means” is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has “intrinsic value”. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion. 

1. “subject” - any being or living thing.
2. “value judgement” - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim) 
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.) 
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently — just that we’ve never seen it happen.) 
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects. 
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects. 
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

2025-08-16 16:49:16,"a redbull fuelled breakdown of why i sleep better with my own keys. for those who saw my last post and now picture me as a redbull junkie with empty cans shaking for a third. it is not true but enjoy the thought as the real me is far less exciting. i drink it maybe twice a month when i feel like treating myself and sit out in my garden and drink it like it is some sort of rare vintage whilst i read the news thinking i look sophisticated enough to understand how the world actually works.

anyway, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how many people keep their bitcoin on exchanges and i'm on about considerable amounts because i know some of you will say ""no point self custodying if you only have £25 and a dream"", but lets be honest if you think that kind of bag is your key to an early retirement then please, treat yourself to a cold wallet and maybe a tattoo on your forehead that reads ""tell me to buy more bitcoin"". on a serious note, how many of you actually read the t&c's when signing up to an exchange? i didn't, but there will also be things that say:

""we reserve the right to suspend withdrawals""

""insolvency may result in partial or total loss of funds""

""in the event of catastrophic failure, we'll send you an automated email with the word ""unfortunately"" and picture of us sipping cocktails funded by everyone who lost their money""

we all know things like this has happened before which is why i'm hoping to at least give one person a sign to finally getting around to ordering that hardware wallet. i also find it a lot easier to hold on to my sats as its a whole ""thing"" to actually get around to liquidating. i do definitely sleep better knowing i'm the only person who has access to my funds and in that worst case scenario, global meltdown, we only need one bitcoiner to keep his node running and we can send some to the local prepper who is selling beans out of his garage.

so if you've got a hardware wallet sat in your shopping basket (the manufactures website of course) then see this as your sign to buy it, just make sure your keys are somewhere secure because its very easy to go half arsed with it at first but when your bag grows and your security doesnt, you're playing with fire.

i hate to sound old but just be sensible and maybe have a redbull just before unboxing ;).

i was hoping to do a poll but it didnt seem to let me as i was quite interested to se what the results would be. i hope this post was entertaining but if not it just gave me something to do on my saturday afternoon. if anyone has any questions about self custody then please just ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ms0p5y/a_redbull_fuelled_breakdown_of_why_i_sleep_better/,1,1,1ms0p5y,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9909

(https://x.com/soaker\_patoshi)

in the previous essay ([bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1mrl65c/bitcoin_most_certainly_violates_mises_regression/)) we ended with statements by mises that his (austrian) school of thought ""praxeology"" rejects empirical (think archeological) based arguments and only accepts arguments extended from reason. 

here we will show countless examples of saifedean ammous, a purported austrian economics professor relying on empirical based points and arguments trying to make his conclusion about the economic implications of bitcoin. 

in this essay i use the perspective and intention of szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with mises regression theorem, to highlight saifedean ammous’ nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including mises, hayek, and nash as well as implicitly szabo and satoshi.  
  
further i highlight that saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to jo walton, “the analogy between bitcoin and yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.“  
  
this essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‘un-wrapped’ using szabonian deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as and money-like things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).

i’m wondering:
	1.	what’s your personal bitcoin strategy? (e.g., buy-and-hold, dca, trading, staking, etc.)
	2.	for someone who only has a bit invested from years ago, do you think it’s still worth putting money into btc now?
	3.	any tips for managing risk or timing for new investors?

i'm not daring enough to claim it's the first magnetic board. however, i think it could be ""one of the first,"" as i haven't found one online.

it's the boards to attatch the green and red bars to update the in-game prices in real time.

its core concept is to survive against inflation and collect the most wealth points to be a winner.

we've hosted a big event in thailand to let people test the game with more than 200+ joining in. and the feedback is almost all positive.

it's on the less than 25 hours final kickstarter day to end the campaign, so you could check it out.

2025-08-20 12:21:37,"bitsend – first offline bitcoin wallet demo (proof of concept, testnet)   
hey everyone,  
bitsend is the world’s first truly offline-capable bitcoin wallet.

i just want to share something i’ve been working on for a long time.  
i’m not a genius, i’m not backed by a big company, i’m just a regular guy who managed to build something new step by step, alone, with passion and persistence.

what you will see in this video is not just an app – it’s a whole ecosystem i created from scratch. the goal was simple:

* to make bitcoin transactions possible even without internet, instantly.
* to give users full privacy and security, since everything works offline by default.
* to prove that a new hybrid model (cold–hot wallet in one) is possible.

this is only a **proof of concept on testnet**, but it shows that bitcoin can be broadcast and managed in ways that weren’t available before.

i know some will doubt, some will criticize, but for me this is just the beginning. i wanted to share it here 

this is a proof of concept demo running on testnet.  



features shown in this demo:  

\- offline balance check  

\- offline transaction signing  

\- automatic relay to the bitcoin network (without user internet)  



this is not just an app — it’s a full ecosystem that works even in crisis or without internet access.  

future versions will support multi-token and fiat integrations.
