2025-07-28 20:48:11+00:00,"btc dipped after getting shafted at $119k where's the momentum going? so we just watched btc drop to $117.9k today with $47.5 million getting liquidated, and honestly this whole $119k rejection is getting concerning. we've seen this level turn into a brick wall multiple times now and each attempt is getting weaker.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

anyone else getting frustrated watching this same rejection play out over and over? feels like we're stuck in groundhog day at this level.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mbrx9v/btc_dipped_after_getting_shafted_at_119k_wheres/,0,12,1mbrx9v,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-28 18:28:21+00:00,"ethereum can outperform bitcoin in next few months mike novogratz dropped some bold predictions on cnbc  eth outperforming btc in the next 3-6 months and potentially hitting that $4,000 resistance multiple times. then galaxy digital immediately sold 10,000 btc, sending bitcoin tumbling down

novogratz isn't abandoning bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and galaxy holds 13,504 btc. but they're clearly making a calculated rotation into ethereum, now holding 64,858 eth as their second-largest position.

 while bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their btc purchases, ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. that's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.

companies like bitmine immersion with 566,766 eth and sharplink gaming with 360,807 eth are betting big on this model. ether machine is even going public on nasdaq with $1.5 billion committed to ethereum.

the numbers back up the sentiment too. ethereum etfs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during july while bitcoin etfs managed $827 million. blackrock's etha is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for eth exposure is accelerating.

what i find compelling is the yield component. bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in defi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. that's a different value proposition entirely.

they're positioning for a trend where corporate treasuries don't just store value  they actively generate yield. the genius act supporting stablecoin infrastructure only strengthens ethereum's position as the settlement layer for institutional operations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mbo6q5/ethereum_can_outperform_bitcoin_in_next_few_months/,4,8,1mbo6q5,reddit,CryptoMarkets

2025-07-27 22:10:30+00:00,"alts into btc i’m thinking about converting all my altcoins, mainly eth and sol, into bitcoin. the only thing holding me back is that i’m not entirely sure if now is the best time to make that move. part of me feels like it could be worth waiting a bit longer, maybe to see if eth and sol push closer to new all-time highs before making the switch.

at the moment, my portfolio is around 80 percent btc and 20 percent in alts. to be honest, i’ve reached a point where i believe that, in the long run, bitcoin is really the only asset that matters in this space. everything else just seems less solid or even irrelevant compared to btc.

so now i’m asking myself and you, what would be the smarter move? should i go ahead and move everything into btc now, or stay patient and wait for a potentially better opportunity to exit my alt positions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1maz3pf/alts_into_btc/,25,80,1maz3pf,reddit,CryptoMarkets
