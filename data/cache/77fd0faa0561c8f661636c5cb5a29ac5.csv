2025-03-18 15:45:55+00:00,"trump's second term: pro-crypto, controversial tariffs, and a strategic bitcoin reserve by now, most of the world has settled into the early months of trump's second term, and it's already been eventful. aside from the multiple aviation disasters that shook the first quarter of 2025, one of the defining aspects of his presidency so far has been his aggressive push for a pro-crypto agenda.

after actively courting industry support during his campaign, trump has wasted no time in delivering on his promises. key developments include:

âœ… **a strategic bitcoin reserve** â€“ the administration has announced plans to accumulate btc, signaling a shift in how the u.s. treats the asset.  
âœ… **the first-ever white house crypto summit** â€“ bringing together industry leaders and policymakers to discuss regulation and adoption.  
âœ… **tariffs on major economies** â€“ new trade tariffs on countries like canada and china have sparked controversy, but some argue they indirectly benefit bitcoin by increasing demand for non-sovereign assets.

love him or hate him, it's clear trump is making moves that could shape the future of crypto. what do you thinkâ€”bullish for bitcoin or just more political noise?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1je81lf/trumps_second_term_procrypto_controversial/,2,0,1je81lf,reddit,CryptoCurrencyTrading
