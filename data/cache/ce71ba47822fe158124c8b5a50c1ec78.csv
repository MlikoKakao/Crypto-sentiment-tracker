which is better central banking or bitcoin? 

philosophical question here(i'm a long term holder of bitcoin but still ponder on these). 

if the u.s. or another country pegged its dollar to bitcoin, the economy would likely face massive >problems because bitcoin has a fixed supply. as the economy grows, money wouldn’t grow with it, causing prices to fall (deflation). that sounds good at first, but it makes people hoard money instead of spending or investing, and it makes debts harder to pay back. the government and federal reserve would also lose tools like lowering interest rates or creating more money to fight recessions. overall, it would make the economy rigid and unstable—similar to the old gold standard, but even stricter—slowing growth and making crises worse.
bitcoin would ultimately ruin our modern economy, through deflation.  something worse than inflation.

2025-08-19 17:25:28+00:00,"1971 broke money 1971 — nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 — us debt explodes  
1971 — wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 — dollar = debt  
1971 — petrodollar born  
1971 — families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 — women pushed to work (“liberation”)

1971 didn’t change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it’s $34 trillion.

that’s not growth. that’s theft—paid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year… for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education—everything essential—started outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of “liberation.” but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me…

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 — federal reserve created  
1913 — income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed’s scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn’t lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don’t serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn’t just blood + bombs. it’s debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq… all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that’s how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
🔹 us national debt → $400b → $34t+  
🔹 inflation steals \~97% of the dollar’s value  
🔹 wealth gap explodes  
🔹 the “american dream” dies for most families  
🔹 dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don’t hold cash. they hold assets—real estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you’re told to “save” while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can’t be repaid and the system collapses.

that’s why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today’s chaos…

2025-08-19 17:13:48+00:00,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

· for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
· for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,5,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin

2025-08-19 05:33:10+00:00,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we’ve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the “ wen lambo” crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

i’m building a wallet that lets you move btc out of exchanges into a non-custodial wallet, and then trade/spend using lightning + submarine swaps.
the goal: ditch custodians, trade freely.
looking for early testnet users & feedback. dm if interested! ⚡",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mtuo4t/working_on_a_lightning_wallet_for_selfcustody/,6,3,1mtuo4t,reddit,Bitcoin
2025-08-18 18:25:26+00:00,"btc vs real estate i'm at a cross roads. i'm at a point in my life where i've done it, i've accumulated over 1 btc. i make a (barely) livable wage (yippie, the american dream in 2025).

up to/including this point, i have minimal expenses (under $300/month). so i've been apeing my pay checks into btc since january 2024.

i moved for a promotion recently and am staying with a family member who i'm not quite compatible with.

i'm able to purchase a home in this area and it would give me a greater sense of peace to have my own space/place.

my dilemma is if i should continue using the vast amount of my pay checks to buy btc until 2028 or pull the trigger and switch tracks in my financial narrative.

doing this would mean i keep the btc i have, but won't be accumulating any more. i have enough for a down payment, and my pay checks would be going to mortgage payments/life on my own necessities.

would do you guys think? we all know the real estate market is crazy over priced and not slowing down. will it outpace btc by 2028? if so, the smart thing to do would be to buy a home now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mtu613/btc_vs_real_estate/,13,52,1mtu613,reddit,Bitcoin
