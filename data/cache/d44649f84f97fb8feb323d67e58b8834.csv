luckily, we have been fortunate to not experience this yet, but in the scenario where this happens, bitcoin miners profits will decline immediately, which will cause less liquid miners to shut down. this would directly affect the security of the network. now, at this point the block difficulty would adjust, so mining would be cheaper, which would in turn cause more mining again and the cycle repeats. 

this is where transaction fees come in. basically, in the scenario that bitcoin's reward is too low, fees are supposed to incentivize miners to keep mining. but how are fees supposed to incentivize miners if block rewards are decreasing at a rate greater than transaction fees are growing?  
  
i'm specifically referring to price\*block reward too, so 3.125\*110000= $343,750 total reward per block. this means that the compensation per block must not go below this number without suffering losses in hash rate... right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1n0s317/longterm_network_security_incentives/,2,9,1n0s317,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9831

2025-08-26 16:44:39+00:00,"grok’s btc vs. usd video game analogy 🤯 i thought this was cool so i thought i would share. my prompt was based on some buttcoiner saying btc was “fake internet money”. :

imagine you’re playing a massive online multiplayer game where the in-game currency is used to buy everything—from virtual houses to weapons. critics of bitcoin often dismiss it as “fake internet money” because it’s digital, not backed by physical assets like gold, and created through complex computer processes (mining) rather than a central authority. but here’s an analogy that flips the script: **the us dollar (usd) is essentially the same kind of “fake internet money,” except it’s controlled by a single player with cheat codes, while bitcoin has built-in rules limiting how much can ever exist.**
picture the federal reserve (the fed) as the game’s all-powerful admin. when banks need more money to lend out (like when the economy slows down), the fed doesn’t dig it up from some vault or mine it from the earth—it just types a few commands into their digital ledger and poof, new bank reserves appear out of thin air. this is called quantitative easing or open market operations. it’s like the admin spawning unlimited gold coins in the game whenever players complain they’re broke. those reserves then multiply through fractional reserve banking, where banks lend out way more than they actually hold, creating even more digital dollars in the system. there’s no hard cap; the supply can inflate endlessly based on the fed’s decisions, which can lead to devaluation (inflation) if they overdo it. sure, it’s “real” money because the government says so and enforces its use through laws and taxes, but at its core, it’s just entries in a computerized database—no different from pixels on a screen.
now, contrast that with bitcoin: it’s like a game where the developers hardcoded a strict limit of 21 million coins ever, enforced by math and a decentralized network of players (miners) who all agree on the rules. no single admin can cheat and spawn more; you have to “earn” it by solving cryptographic puzzles, which gets harder over time. critics call bitcoin “fake” because it’s intangible and volatile, but it has scarcity baked in, making it more like digital gold than the fed’s infinite-print button.
in the end, both are “fake” in the sense that they’re human inventions relying on collective belief and technology to hold value. but if bitcoin is fake internet money, the usd is fake government internet money—with the added risk that the printer never runs out of ink. this analogy highlights why some bitcoin advocates argue it’s a hedge against fiat currencies like the usd, which can be debased at will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1n0qyw4/groks_btc_vs_usd_video_game_analogy/,0,1,1n0qyw4,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.7473

bitlayer uses the bitvm paradigm to bring programmability to bitcoin while maintaining bitcoin level security. users can pay gas fees directly in btc, which makes transactions simple and natural for bitcoin holders. the network also has a trust minimized bridge that issues 1:1 backed assets like ybtc, allowing people to put their bitcoin to work in lending, liquidity, and yield strategies without leaving the ecosystem.

the numbers show strong adoption. bitlayer currently secures around $430m in total value locked, ranking among the top bitcoin layer-2s, and has seen more than 51,000 active users in the past month. looking forward, bitlayer is preparing a major upgrade from a sidechain to a bitcoin native rollup, which would bring greater decentralization and scalability.

the project also has strong backing in asia, supported by a team with deep resources and community figures such as k-line master and he bi. one of the earliest exchanges to support bitlayer was bitget, which integrated the network before many others and continues to provide wallet support. bitlayer is also preparing to launch its token, though the broader story remains focused on how the network is scaling bitcoin for real-world use.

with its combination of smart contract support, secure bridging and upcoming rollup architecture, bitlayer is quickly becoming one of the most interesting experiments in bitcoin’s evolution, taking it beyond digital gold toward being the backbone of scalable defi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1n0lg72/bringing_smart_contracts_defi_to_bitcoin/,0,1,1n0lg72,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9977

i remember this point about deflation:

* money gains value over time
* people don’t consume a lot because money will be worth more tomorrow.
* companies invest less because money will be worth more tomorrow.
* lower wages and higher unemployment fewer jobs and lower salaries mean less money circulating. => people spend even less, pushing prices down further.
* back to the start

i’m both excited and frustrated right now. after weeks of digging, i found that my dad actually bought around **14 btc back in 2015** on blockchain.com. the good news: i managed to recover access to the **email and keystore file** (not json, but the encrypted keystore). the bad news: nobody remembers the password.

here’s where i’m at:

* i’ve tried some tools like **btcrecover** and **hashcat**.
* i have some **password hints** from my dad’s old saved browser passwords (so i’m not shooting completely in the dark).
* i know some services claim they can crack wallets, but most look sketchy and i’d rather not trust strangers with this.

my question:

* has anyone here had **success stories** recovering a blockchain.com wallet with password hints?
* is it realistic to attempt this myself, or is it a dead end without professional help?
* if there are trusted communities or resources you recommend (guides, success stories, etc.), please point me there.

i’m not asking anyone to crack it for me — just want to know what’s actually worked for people and if there’s a **sane path forward** before i waste months on the wrong approach.

thanks in advance 🙏

## update 1 

 just wanted to share where i’m at and hopefully get some feedback:
* i figured out this is a non-custodial wallet. so if i don’t get the password, there’s no recovery option from blockchain.com.

* i went to blockchain.com, logged in with the wallet id, and by entering a wrong password i was able to get back the wallet.aes.json file (encrypted wallet backup).

* i have around 20 base password variations that my dad typically used. using those, i generated about 1 million variants with the help of tools + llms.

* i tried those against the wallet.aes.json using btcrecover (cpu-based), but no luck so far.

my next step: i want to move this to hashcat (gpu-based) so i can test more possibilities.

now i’m considering a few approaches, and would love input from anyone who’s been through something similar:

* expand the wordlist: take my 20 known password hints and generate ~20–50 million variations (instead of just 1m) and run them in hashcat.

* pattern-based attack: try to define regex-style rules or patterns in hashcat, based on what i know about my dad’s password habits, instead of just a big flat wordlist.

other smarter approach? maybe i’m missing a more efficient way to combine hints + patterns so i’m not brute forcing blindly.

so my question is: what’s realistically the best way forward here? is it worth generating massive wordlists, or should i focus on getting good rules/patterns for hashcat?

there are many people who have shared plethora of resources to learn about btc, books like ""the bitcoin standard"", ""broken money"" and videos like ""what's the problem?"" and websites like [https://www.satsvsfiat.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=quffluhqbtjqvwdvdtffaevdt0l4zm9sddhhy2fbdvfjd3xbq3jtc0ttanhrung1lwizbfpwdxvun2o2nknetnztetg4rfdwymlobu5hak5rn0znshlmdjlrb3zoenjuetl1sv9dukrettdny3lymhbsuzayd21kuv94yy1jqnzozwjymmjku2r0zxncltftbxvpnvfwtxewwq&q=https%3a%2f%2fwww.satsvsfiat.com%2f&v=ytfoxnbmd38). before you see the $$$ signs attached next to btc, understand what it is about, why satoshi nakamoto believed in such an idea and decided to share it with the world, why he saw a world where everyone had freedom, where everyone would not work till death against a system that is designed to make them lose. and if you still wish to make $$$ off of bitcoin then at least understand it is not a get rich quick scheme, it is a lesson that patience and perseverance wins, as bitcoin always has against every skeptic, every action of unethical exchanges and attempts of governments to ban it (like the china mining ban a few years back). open your eyes, see the reality. that paper money in your hand is making you weak and the sad part is the more you get of it, the more you believe in it.

2025-08-26 15:05:08+00:00,"how cross-chain bridges work # tl;dr

* cross-chain bridges enable assets, data, and information to be transferred between isolated blockchain networks, providing interoperability.
* interoperability is crucial to unifying isolated blockchain ecosystems and improving user experiences.
* cross-chain bridges provide dapps and tokens with multi-chain strategies that can increase volume, liquidity, and profitability.
* token holders benefit from access to new opportunities, lower fees, and enhanced accessibility.

# understanding how cross-chain bridges work

a cross-chain bridge is a protocol that enables the transfer of assets, data, or information between various blockchain networks. it allows users to interact with different blockchains, unlocking interoperability by facilitating communication and transactions between otherwise isolated ecosystems. bridges are great for transferring tokens, using dapps across chains, and optimizing blockchain functionalities.

# what types of cross-chain bridges are there?

there are several types of bridges in the web3 space, each serving a different purpose and need. as these bridges serve different roles, they operate in different ways. here is a brief overview of different types of bridges: 

**trust-based bridges**

trust-based bridges depend on a centralized authority to facilitate cross-chain asset transfers. despite being less susceptible to hacking, trust-based bridges require trust in the authority. trust-based bridges can support any asset, and all cross-chain bridges tend to fall between the categories of trust-based bridges or trustless bridges.

**trustless bridges**

as its name suggests, trustless bridges operate without a central authority. in contrast, trustless bridges rely on nodes or smart contracts, depending on the type of bridge.

**wrapped asset and altcoin bridges**

many bridges focus on transferring wrapped assets and altcoins across different chains. many of the assets are wrapped versions of popular cryptocurrencies, such as wrapped bitcoin (wbtc), or less popular altcoins and tokens. bridging these assets cross-chain opens up trading and arbitrage opportunities, as well as a higher trading volume on dexs for the asset. 

**stablecoin bridges**

other bridges focus on various stablecoins such as usdt, usdc, and dai. some stablecoin bridges have integrated different bridging protocols, such as circle’s cctp for usdc or chainlink’s ccip, to allow the movement of these assets. 

**nft bridges**

while nfts may have lost some of their glamour, some bridges focus on transferring digital collectibles or nfts across chains. nft bridges tend to be relatively rare, as market interest in digital collectibles has died down, and meme coins have become the recent craze. 

# how do cross-chain bridges work?

there are several types of bridging methods used in cross-chain bridges, depending on the specific bridge. here are a few common methods:

**lock and mint bridging**

one of the most common ways cross-chain bridges work is by using a lock and mint functionality. in this method, tokens are locked on one chain, and an equivalent number of tokens is minted on the other. should the user want to bridge assets back to their original chain, the newly minted version of the tokens is burnt, and the locked tokens are released.

**burn & mint bridging**

as its name suggests, with burn and mint, tokens are burnt (destroyed) on the source chain, and equivalent native tokens are minted on the destination chain. it is popular for one-way token bridging because it removes the source tokens from circulation.

**liquidity pool bridging**

with liquidity pool bridging, a token that exists on multiple blockchains is deposited into a large multi-chain digital pool of liquidity. this liquidity pool allows users to swap the token between supported blockchains easily, and liquidity providers earn a small fee every time a user bridges tokens. this approach eliminates the need for complex minting or burning processes, as tokens are exchanged directly in the liquidity pool.

**atomic swap bridging**

in atomic swap bridging, users swap assets on the source chain for assets on the destination chain. two users agree on the token swap terms, such as the amount and blockchain networks involved. to ensure the security of the transaction, hash time-locked contracts (htlcs) are used to ensure it takes place simultaneously on both chains or not at all

# why interoperability in web3 matters

blockchains are like isolated islands, each with its unique ecosystem, but with limited interaction. the isolation of blockchains creates a massive problem for the end user, which bridges help solve by transferring information and assets, essentially unifying these islands. 

as blockchain and web3 grow, so too will the importance of interoperability.

**the need for cross-chain asset transfer**

for many top dapps and tokens, a multi-chain strategy is essential to stay competitive and maximize profits, avoiding the limitations of running on a single, isolated chain. smaller tokens and dapps also benefit by increasing trading volume through listings on multiple dexs across different chains.

from a token holder’s perspective, cross-chain asset transfers allow access to diverse opportunities, such as lower fees or unique features.

# key benefits of cross-chain bridges

there are many different benefits to using cross-chain bridges, both for dapps and tokenized web3 projects, as well as for token holders. for dapps, cross-chain bridges can help grow their ecosystem. bridging tokens can increase their trading volume and liquidity by getting listed on several dexs. 

token holders, on the other hand, can benefit from a better user experience and easier access to assets.

# challenges and risks

the greatest risk with cross-chain bridges is their security. as the popularity of cross-chain bridges continues to grow, so does the risk of attacks. hackers are constantly seeking vulnerabilities in these protocols, making it essential to stay secure.

most hacks occurred due to flaws in smart contracts. other hacks occurred due to insufficient validation schemes, social engineering, and, as we’ve seen with harmony horizon bridge, private key compromises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1n0obj9/how_crosschain_bridges_work/,4,8,1n0obj9,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9983

2025-08-26 11:42:24+00:00,"need advice from experts hi everyone,
i have a coupke of questions about crypto :
(im a layman and a beginner so ill need as easy of explanations as possible)
1. in blockchain technology, the special codes that you have to match, are they unknown to everyone. i guess what i was confused about was that why cant someone just know what the special code that we have to match is using machines if machines are actually validating the codes.
2. in the normal coins like bitcoin and ethereum, can someone be tracked if the entire transaction history is available in blocks?
3. so apart from speed and tokens being a factor, are there things you can do on bitcoin that you cant do in ethereum or solana and vice versa? 
4. also are there ways to use these currencies to directly pay for things in the real world now without converting them into usfdt or usdc and which ones are best for that
5. which wallets are the best for someone like me (i live in pakistan, idk if that matters)
6. which currency exchanges are the best for me?
7. nowadays for a beginner like me is it better to study coins and invest in them first or study coins a little and focus more on tokens and invest in them?
8. what is the best method of studying and investing in coins/tokens?
9. any general advice you guys have for a beginner like me.

thankyou so much for anyone who puts in effort and time.

i have identified the following support levels: 
0.35
0.63 
 and resistances:
0.9 
1.35 
2.2
the chart to date on daily timeframe shows what i think is a symmetric triangle.
ema 200 signals a price below threshold for a long time.
volumes are slightly down, thus signaling uncertainty and waiting for break out or break of the 0.63 level.
if we enter the fibonacci chart on the last move, we are now retesting the 61.8 level.

the trend in my opinion is overall bullish, after several months of descent. 
finally a as far as fundamental analysis is concerned i believe there may be an alt season imminent given: 
dominance of btc in big drop 
last part of btc ""bull season"" post halving 
eth at ath levels

2025-08-26 08:19:11+00:00,"mind-blowing, little-known crypto concepts **1. liquidity = life force**

* **what most don’t know:** a token can look “valuable” on coinmarketcap, but without liquidity it’s just paper wealth. price ≠ real exit.
* **real-world example:** imagine your house is “valued” at $10 million. but if only one buyer is willing to pay $3 millions, your real liquidity is $3 millions. same with low-liquidity coins → you *can’t sell at the displayed price*.
* **insider trick:** always check “liquidity depth” in pools/exchanges before buying anything new.

**2. tokenomics beat hype**

* **what most don’t know:** supply mechanics matter more than marketing. a token with infinite supply (like doge) behaves differently from a deflationary one (like eth after eip-1559).
* **analogy:** owning a business. one prints new shares every day (inflation), the other buys back shares (deflation). which stock would you rather hold long-term?
* **insider trick:** look at *vesting schedules*. if 80% of supply unlocks next month for insiders, price will crash.

**3. mev (miner/maximal extractable value)**

* **what most don’t know:** bots & validators *front-run your trades*.
* **analogy:** you go to a gold shop to buy a coin. a middleman sneaks in, buys it 1 second before you, then sells it to you for 2% higher. that’s what bots do on ethereum.
* **insider trick:** use mev-protected exchanges like **cowswap** or aggregators to avoid silent losses.

**4. stablecoins = shadow banking**

* **what most don’t know:** tether (usdt) and usdc aren’t just “stable money,” they’re *unregulated central banks*. they print billions of “dollars” without full audits.
* **analogy:** imagine your neighborhood grocery issuing its own “gift coupons” and everyone in town starts using them as money. suddenly, the grocery owner is more powerful than your local bank.
* **insider trick:** always diversify stablecoin holdings (usdt + usdc + dai) because one failing could wreck portfolios.

**5. whale games & liquidity hunts**

* **what most don’t know:** 90% of liquidation crashes are *engineered*. whales push prices to trigger stop losses.
* **analogy:** a shark sees a fishing net full of fish. he smashes the net to make the fish panic and scatter, then eats them cheap. whales do the same → forcing liquidations to buy cheap.
* **insider trick:** never place obvious stop-losses at round numbers (like $20,000 btc). that’s *exactly* where whales hunt.

**6. network effects > technology**

* **what most don’t know:** the “best” blockchain doesn’t always win. adoption beats tech.
* **analogy:** qwerty keyboards are not the most efficient, but everyone uses them, so they dominate. same with bitcoin/ethereum → their network adoption matters more than speed or cost.
* **insider trick:** invest in ecosystems with strong developer + user community, not just fast transactions.

**7. governance is power**

* **what most don’t know:** in daos and defi, holding governance tokens = *controlling the protocol*. insiders quietly accumulate governance tokens to steer projects in their favor.
* **analogy:** owning a few shares of a company doesn’t matter, but if you hold 51% voting rights, you can change the ceo. same with daos.
* **insider trick:** watch where venture capitalists accumulate governance tokens — they’re future puppet masters.

**8. time horizons change risk**

* **what most don’t know:** every crypto strategy works… until it doesn’t.
* **analogy:** playing musical chairs. if you’re in for 30 seconds, you win. if you stay for 5 minutes, the music stops and you’re wrecked.
* **insider trick:** decide *before entry* → is this a 1-hour trade, 3-month swing, or 5-year hodl? otherwise you’ll get trapped.

**9. narratives pump markets more than fundamentals**

* **what most don’t know:** most bull runs are driven by *stories*, not facts. “defi summer,” “nft boom,” “ai + crypto.”
* **analogy:** think of fashion trends. it’s not about the *quality* of the fabric but the *story* behind it. crypto markets behave the same.
* **insider trick:** spot the next narrative before retail does → ai tokens, rwa (real-world assets), privacy, etc.

**10. your private keys = your citizenship**

* **what most don’t know:** owning crypto isn’t about speculation — it’s digital sovereignty.
* **analogy:** imagine your passport and bank account rolled into one key. if you lose it, you’re stateless and penniless. if you guard it, you’re your own nation.
* **insider trick:** use multisig wallets or hardware wallets like ledger/trezor. treat them like your passport + house deed combined.

2025-08-26 08:10:11+00:00,"large correction incoming? or manipulated shake-out? hi, just wanted to see where everyones heads at rn, i've been through countless shakeouts in my years in crypto and this feels just like one, however some technicals suggest that we could be heading to a potential month long correction.

my guess would be that there are still alot of fools who are longing with high leverage at every dip and making it easy for market makers/whales to flush out leverage and as soon as those fools are exhausted, we then go for the massive $30b in liquidations waiting at $130k btc. news has also suddenly turnt bearish, youtube comments are not calling this the 'market top', x comments are no longer saying $1000 xrp lol, these are all psychological signs that we are at a bottom from my experience  
  
but as always, the crypto market does the opposite of what i expect, so a long ass correction is also very possible

2025-08-26 07:56:24+00:00,"ethereum at all-time highs, altcoin season on the horizon. which microcaps are you watching? with ethereum climbing close to new all-time highs and bitcoin dominance showing some interesting movements, many in the space are already preparing for the long-awaited altcoin season.

historically, when eth gains momentum, capital tends to flow into mid-caps and eventually into microcaps. we’re already seeing strong signs of stabilization and consolidation across the market – the kind of setup that often precedes explosive altcoin runs.

i’ve been researching different microcaps in the rwa (real-world asset) sector since that narrative is gaining traction. one example is **rem**, a utility token focused on real estate metaverse integration. it’s still tiny compared to others, but i find the microcap/rwa combo interesting given how eth dominance is shaping up.

curious to hear your thoughts:

* do you think this eth rally will trigger a proper altcoin season?
* which sectors (ai, rwa, gaming, defi) do you think will benefit the most?
* are there any microcaps you’re personally keeping an eye on?

thought to allocate 50k on btc, 40k on eth and 10k on xrp, just because these look the most “stable” and promising for a long time investment.

1.	⁠is this the right allocation, or would you change something? remember i’m looking for fairly stable and promising currencies rather than meme coins.
2.	⁠i keep reading that in september everything will go down (good time to buy?) , on the other hand i hear that 2026 there is going to be a crash before the next run. so the question is - how to time the buy?
