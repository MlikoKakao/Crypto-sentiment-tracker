1971 ‚Äî us debt explodes  
1971 ‚Äî wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 ‚Äî dollar = debt  
1971 ‚Äî petrodollar born  
1971 ‚Äî families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 ‚Äî women pushed to work (‚Äúliberation‚Äù)

1971 didn‚Äôt change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it‚Äôs $34 trillion.

that‚Äôs not growth. that‚Äôs theft‚Äîpaid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year‚Ä¶ for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education‚Äîeverything essential‚Äîstarted outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me‚Ä¶

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 ‚Äî federal reserve created  
1913 ‚Äî income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed‚Äôs scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn‚Äôt lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don‚Äôt serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn‚Äôt just blood + bombs. it‚Äôs debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq‚Ä¶ all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that‚Äôs how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
üîπ us national debt ‚Üí $400b ‚Üí $34t+  
üîπ inflation steals \~97% of the dollar‚Äôs value  
üîπ wealth gap explodes  
üîπ the ‚Äúamerican dream‚Äù dies for most families  
üîπ dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don‚Äôt hold cash. they hold assets‚Äîreal estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsave‚Äù while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can‚Äôt be repaid and the system collapses.

that‚Äôs why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today‚Äôs chaos‚Ä¶  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

2025-08-19 17:13:48+00:00,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

¬∑ for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
¬∑ for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,5,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9455

# 2025 top ten portfolio vs. coinbase‚Äôs coin50

the first top ten crypto experiment was started on 1 january 2018 in an attempt to¬†***capture the gains of the entire market***. much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens¬†[like i do for my experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

this year‚Äôs friendly competition is between the 2025 top ten portfolio and the coinbase 50 index¬†**(coin50)**.¬†¬†**coin50**¬†tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

on 1 january 2025,¬†**coin50**¬†was valued at $450.54.¬† here‚Äôs the snapshot, seven months later:¬†

# combining the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 top ten crypto portfolios¬†

the 2025 top ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.¬† so, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the top ten crypto index fund experiments?

* 2018 top ten experiment: up +80% (total value $1,804)
* 2019 top ten experiment: up +847% (total value $9,474)
* 2020 top ten experiment: up +1109% (total value $12,086) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 top ten experiment: up +403% (total value $5,025)
* 2022 top ten experiment: down +2% (total value $1,019)
* 2023 top ten experiment: up +216% (total value $3,156)
* 2024 top ten experiment: up +78% (total value $1,780)
* 2025 top ten experiment: down -0.4% (total value $966) (¬†***worst performing portfolio****)*

taking the eight portfolios together:

**after a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 top ten cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$35,340.**

https://preview.redd.it/ongar9d7e6kf1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=23cddfcbf07e15147ffb60432546b8487ffa849f

**that‚Äôs up +342%**¬†on the combined portfolios. the peak for the combined top ten index fund experiment portfolios was¬†[**november 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.¬†¬†

here‚Äôs the combined monthly roi since i started tracking the metric in january 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/keutvw98e6kf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca287c079005ff1d8b676e9975493df11c1e29f

in summary:¬†***that‚Äôs a +342% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the top ten on january 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# comparison to s&p 500

i‚Äôm also tracking the s&p 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/n75xt4x9e6kf1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=780dd4423ecb606c0f528e8e307be11e66ac7c25

the s&p 500 is up +6% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on new year‚Äôs day would be worth $1,061 had it been redirected to the s&p.

taking the same invest-$1,000-on-january-1st-of-each-year approach with the s&p 500 that i‚Äôve been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2018 = $2,334 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2019 = $2,489 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2020 = $1,931 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2021 = $1,661 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2022 = $1,309 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2023 = $1,625 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2024 = $1,308 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2025 = $1,061 today

taken together, the results for a similar approach with the s&p:¬†

**after eight $1,000 annual investments on january 1st into an s&p 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,717.**

that is up¬†**+71%**¬†[since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+342%**¬†gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios.¬†¬†

the visual below shows¬†a comparison on roi between a top ten crypto approach and the s&p as per the rules of the top ten experiments:¬†¬†

2025-08-20 03:40:59+00:00,"where will eth treasury companies bring eth price? fundamental global inc. (fgf on nasdaq) has filed for a 5 billion usd shelf offering. the company says most of the proceeds will be used to buy ethereum.

they apparently state they will:

\- hold eth as a long-term treasury asset

\- stake, restake, and participate in defi to grow eth per share

\- focus entirely on eth accumulation and value accretion for shareholders

this makes them one of now thirteen ""eth treasuries"" companies whose sole mandate is to accumulate as much eth as possible and deploy it in the ethereum economy.

it seems like wall street is pouring money into ethereum and this reflects its price. does it still have room to grow tho?

ethereum co-founder joe lubin has suggested treasury companies like this could help eth overtake btc in market value, possibly within a year. vitalik buterin has said eth as a treasury asset is ""good and valuable,"" but also warns that if these treasuries become overleveraged, they could destabilize the ecosystem.

2025-08-19 23:30:09+00:00,"how and when should i get back into crypto? (10k) hi!

i was recently blessed with a $10k bonus and i‚Äôd like to invest it in bitcoin. i‚Äôve been into crypto for years, but at some point i stopped following the news and just kept holding my bag‚Äîno sales, no new purchases.

based on my analysis of bitcoin‚Äôs halving cycles, the best approach might be to invest $1‚Äì2k every month over the next 5‚Äì10 months. putting it all in right now could be risky if we see a strong 20‚Äì30% correction, while stretching it out too long, for example, $500 per month for 20 months, would mean i‚Äôd still be buying at the start of the next bear market.

instead of holding everything, i trimmed about 40% of my alt positions, rotated a good portion into bitcoin, and parked roughly 25% in usdc. it wasn‚Äôt about bragging or timing the top, more about not letting one bad candle erase months of work. i‚Äôve seen too many people ride profits back down to zero.

my question for people here who‚Äôve been through this: how do you approach a run like this? do you set hard cash-out percentages, like pulling 20% at certain milestones, or do you rebalance into safer assets as the market shifts? my biggest fear right now is giving back profit rather than missing new upside.
