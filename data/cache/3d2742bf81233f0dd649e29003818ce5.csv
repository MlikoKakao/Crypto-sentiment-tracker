2025-08-23 15:59:16+00:00,"what happens if governments turn hostile to bitcoin owners and kyc data leaks? here’s a concern i’ve been thinking about that i don’t see discussed enough:

when you buy bitcoin from a kyc exchange (like okx, coinbase, binance, etc.), your purchase is permanently tied to your identity. they have your passport, your address, your withdrawal history, and which wallets you sent to. that data doesn’t just disappear, it’s stored in centralized databases, often in multiple jurisdictions, sometimes indefinitely.

now, imagine a future where governments or regimes take a hostile stance toward bitcoin ownership itself, not just trading or mining.

	•	scenario 1: a country makes it illegal to own bitcoin, not just use it for transactions. suddenly, the mere fact that your name appears in leaked kyc data could be enough for prosecution.

	•	scenario 2: you travel or move to a restrictive country (china, nepal, algeria, etc.). even if ownership isn’t illegal today, regimes change. a leaked kyc database could tie your name to large bitcoin holdings, and you could be treated as a criminal just for having them.

	•	scenario 3: governments use kyc exchange data retroactively. maybe bitcoin stays legal, but authorities decide to crack down on “unreported wealth” or impose special taxes. if your kyc records show large holdings, you could be targeted years later, even if your coins have long since moved into cold storage.

so my question is:
has anyone else thought seriously about this? are we underestimating the risk that kyc exchange records could become a liability in the future, not just for privacy, but for personal safety and legal status?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1my5792/what_happens_if_governments_turn_hostile_to/,4,25,1my5792,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.904
2025-08-23 15:34:07+00:00,"bitcoin etf flows and jackson hole: why market manipulation seems obvious the recent market behavior around the jackson hole meeting raises serious questions about whether we are truly witnessing natural supply and demand — or a coordinated play to liquidate retail traders.

# 1. the etf flow reversal before jackson hole

thanks for reading! subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

until a day before the jackson hole meeting, bitcoin-related etfs showed a steady **net outflow** of funds.  
this naturally signaled to retail investors that inflation fears could push the market lower, leading many to take **high-leverage short positions**.

but on thursday — **one day before jackson hole** — etf flows suddenly turned positive.  
if the dovish tone (rate cut hints) was only confirmed *after* powell’s speech, etfs should have remained flat at best.  
instead, inflows began early, suggesting that **informed players moved ahead of the news**.

# 2. media narrative vs. real money

press enter or click to view image in full size

interestingly, while etf inflows had already started, the media kept flooding the headlines with **“inflation concerns”** stories.

* actual money was flowing in,
* but news coverage made it seem reckless to go long, pushing retail traders further into shorts.

this disconnect between flows and headlines looks less like coincidence and more like **orchestrated sentiment manipulation**.

# 3. the long/short liquidation cycle

press enter or click to view image in full size

the week leading up to jackson hole played out like a textbook liquidation cycle:

* **mon–wed: etf outflows → short inducement**
* binance lifted prices slightly before u.s. market open → luring retail longs
* sharp drops after the open → **long liquidation**
* **thursday: etf inflows begin**
* but headlines still screamed “inflation risk”
* retail traders doubled down on shorts
* **friday (jackson hole): sharp price spike**
* high-leverage shorts wiped out
* short covering cascade pushed prices even higher
* result: **whales profit from both long and short liquidations**

# 4. the bigger picture

when we connect the dots —

* etf flows shifting ahead of official news,
* media pushing the opposite narrative,
* exchange-driven intraday whipsaws —

it looks far less like random market behavior and far more like a **coordinated play between u.s. financial institutions and major exchanges like binance to extract liquidity from retail traders**.

# conclusion

this episode is a reminder that in bitcoin markets, the signals to watch are not headlines but **real money flows**.  
whenever etf flows, media narratives, and leverage positioning diverge, it often sets the stage for engineered volatility — where retail traders inevitably pay the price.

2025-08-23 14:31:36+00:00,"how miners accumulated thousands of btc when it was below $1 back in bitcoin’s early days, mining was nothing like it is today. there were no massive farms, no asic rigs, and definitely no huge electricity bills. most early miners were just enthusiasts running bitcoin core on their laptops or desktops for fun, solving blocks with cpus and later gpus. the block reward at the time was 50 btc per block, and because the network was so small, it was possible for an individual to mine several blocks in a single day without any competition.

what’s crazy to think about now is that back then, bitcoin wasn’t worth anything to most people. it was trading for pennies, or even zero in some cases. there were no centralized exchanges like binance, bitget, or okx to make buying easy. if you wanted bitcoin, you either mined it yourself or traded it peer to peer with someone on forums like bitcointalk. many early miners were doing it out of curiosity, not for profit, because there wasn’t even a clear use case beyond digital money at that time.

some miners ended up accumulating thousands of btc without realizing what they had. imagine running your pc overnight and waking up to hundreds of coins mined effortlessly. the famous 10,000 btc for two pizzas story happened during this era because people still did not value btc as real money. a lot of early adopters even deleted wallets or lost private keys because they did not think those coins would ever be worth anything significant.

looking back, it is a powerful reminder of two things: how far bitcoin has come, and how early conviction and curiosity can change everything. if you had been there, would you have held on to those coins or sold at the first $1?",https://i.redd.it/d0sed9n25skf1.jpeg,236,27,1my2zto,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.0444

for many users, this kind of market volatility makes timing the market tricky. one approach to consider is dollar-cost averaging or dca. by spreading purchases out over time, for example $1,000 per month, investors can reduce the pressure of trying to catch a bottom or a top. historical trends show that regular dca purchases in bitcoin over the past year could have delivered solid returns, even during choppy markets.

automatic or recurring purchase strategies can help users steadily build exposure while managing risk. by setting up consistent contributions over time, investors can accumulate gradually and participate in broader market trends without relying on perfect timing.

2025-08-23 09:59:17+00:00,"the us might use ""spare"" $863b to buy bitcoin tldr by ai:

the article discusses a potential hidden strategy involving gold and bitcoin, suggesting that key figures like federal reserve chair jerome powell, former president donald trump, and treasury secretary scott bessent are aware of a significant financial maneuver that could impact the u.s. economy.

### key points

- gold revaluation: a recent federal reserve paper outlines how countries have historically revalued gold to mask financial instability. the article implies that the u.s. could be considering a similar approach, given that gold is currently valued on the books at $42.22 per ounce, a price set in 1973, while the market price is around $3,400. this discrepancy creates a **potential $863 billion** gap.

- bitcoin ambitions: trump is reportedly interested in establishing a u.s. sovereign wealth fund funded by bitcoin, aiming to make the u.s. a ""crypto superpower."" the article connects this ambition to a congressional bill proposing **the use of gold revaluation to finance bitcoin purchases**.

- economic implications: the author warns that if the u.s. admits to the devaluation of the dollar and the true value of gold, it could lead to significant market chaos, including rising interest rates and a decrease in purchasing power for the average american.

- political dynamics: the article suggests that political leaders are reluctant to admit the truth about the u.s. monetary system, fearing the political fallout. it hints that a crisis might force a reckoning, potentially leading to a revaluation of gold and a shift in monetary policy.

overall, the piece paints a picture of a financial system on the brink of a significant transformation, driven by hidden truths about gold and the dollar's value, with potential ramifications for bitcoin and the broader economy.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-secret-powell-trump-and-bessent-arent-telling-us-about-gold-and-bitcoin-762e33f6,226,54,1mxxeoi,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9661
2025-08-23 09:38:19+00:00,"bitcoin analysis: bulls face key test at 117k? bitcoin rebounded sharply from the 112,000 support, printing a strong bullish candle and reclaiming higher ground. price is now consolidating just below the 117,050 resistance, where sellers are trying to cap the upside.
the recovery remains constructive, but btc must hold above 114,800 to keep momentum. a failure here could re-expose deeper supports.

outlook
• upside: a breakout above 117,050 could unlock 118,650. sustained momentum beyond this strengthens the bullish trend.
• downside: support sits at 114,800, then 112,000. a break below 112,000 risks 110,600, where stronger buyers may reappear.

trend
short-term trend is recovering bullish, but btc sits at a critical resistance (117,050). above 114,800 = bulls in control. rejection at resistance = possible pullback.

strategy
• buying dips near 114,800–112,000 with stops under 110,600 = favorable r:r.
• breakout above 117,050 → target 118,650.
• rejection → pullback trades toward 114,800–112,000.

[the eternal growth illusion](https://preview.redd.it/z1tfbup9nnkf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d026dd1c1bf3fd9ffce3dbf42cc30cabb64678b9)

since the first industrial revolution, global gdp exploded from a few hundred billion to **$105 trillion in 2024**. the assumption? at least 3% annual growth.

problem is… the earth is finite. resources, energy, ecological limits, growth isn’t infinite.

if gdp really grew 3% per year, global output would **double every 24 years**. by 2048, we could hit **$218 trillion**. and yet, people still value infinitely printable money over something like bitcoin, which is **provably scarce**.

[bitcoin checks every box](https://preview.redd.it/had16s8bnnkf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc6a9ba79115ac9415b6396b581a0bbaeab7639d)

* **scarcity:** only 21 million btc will ever exist. fiat? central banks can (and do) print trillions out of thin air.
* **divisibility:** down to 1 satoshi (0.00000001 btc) — perfect for micro-transactions.
* **portability:** send millions across the globe in minutes. try doing that with cash or gold.
* **recognizability:** public ledger, cryptographic proofs, global awareness — easier to verify than most coins or bills.
* **durability:** won’t corrode, burn, or degrade. as long as you protect your wallet or seed phrase, it’s eternal.

[the big question](https://preview.redd.it/qehvry9gnnkf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=789600fd2af48d1af51f0d6067efc70ddfb7a9ac)

put it all together, and bitcoin might be **the most advanced form of money ever created**. yet the market still treats it like a speculative asset instead of a **long-term, decentralized store of value**.

fiat keeps inflating. gdp models assume eternal growth — but the planet has limits. bitcoin offers the opposite: scarcity, durability, global portability.

and still… in 2025, we have to ask:

**why is bitcoin still so cheap?**

2025-08-22 18:45:01+00:00,"understanding pow hello everyone, i have been researching proof of work (pow) in bitcoin and i was having a hard time understanding it.
with the help of chat gpt i put together this explanation step by step, from the most basic to the technical, for anyone who wants to understand how it really works.

it was very helpful for me to finally understand it. 


---

step 1 — the problem that pow solves

in an open network, without a central boss, we have two problems:

1. sort blocks at a stable rate → we want blocks to come out every ~10 minutes, not all at once.


2. avoid cheating with fake identities (sybil attack) → anyone can create thousands of accounts, but with pow what matters is not the identities, but the real computing capacity.



👉 pow decides who proposes the next block and at what pace, using something expensive to fake but cheap to verify: computational work.


---

step 2 — what does a block contain?

a block has two parts:

header (80 bytes in bitcoin):

version: version of the block.

prev_block_hash: hash of the previous block (to chain them together).

merkle_root: summary of all transactions (merkle tree).

timestamp: time declared by the miner.

nbits: the target (difficulty).

nonce: 32-bit number that the miner changes over and over again.


👉 the proof of work is done on this header: double sha-256.

body (transactions):

list of valid transactions.

a special one called coinbase, which creates the miner's reward.

an extranonce can be included in the coinbase to vary the merkle_root and generate more possible headers.



---

step 3 — the puzzle: hash ≤ target

the rule is:

\text{sha256(sha256(block\_header))} \leq \text{target}

the hash is a 256-bit random number.

the target is a threshold: the lower it, the more difficult.

miners change nonce, timestamp or the merkle_root to generate new headers.


👉 it's like throwing 256-sided dice billions of times until a number less than the target comes up.


---

step 4 — when someone wins

if a miner finds a valid hash:

1. broadcast the entire block to the network.


2. nodes verify:

that the hash meets the difficulty.

that the header and transactions are valid.

that the reward does not exceed what is allowed.



3. if all is well, they add the block to their copy of the chain.



👉 the reward is only valid if the network accepts the block → it is not in the miner's best interest to cheat.


---

step 5 — the accumulated work

nodes always follow the chain with the most accumulated work, not simply the longest.

example:

chain a: 3 blocks, each with difficulty 100 → accumulated work = 300.

chain b: 4 blocks, difficulty 10 → cumulative = 40.
👉 although b has more blocks, a is correct because it has more work.


this makes:

rewriting history from behind involves redoing all that accumulated work.

with less than 50% power you would never reach the honest chain.



---

step 6 — energy and security

pow connects the digital with the physical:

each hashing attempt requires electricity and specialized hardware.

expending real energy makes attempts costly.

verifying a hash is almost free.


this protects the network because:

to attack it you need to spend more energy than the entire network combined.

attacking would be very expensive and would destroy the value of the currency → it is not profitable.


👉 bitcoin security is measured in watts.


---

step 7 — difficulty in real numbers

today (2025), bitcoin's hashrate is around 600 eh/s (600 × 10^18 attempts/second).

the current difficulty is around 85 billion (85t).

every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) the network adjusts the difficulty to maintain 1 block every 10 minutes.


👉 it is an automatic “thermostat”: if there are more miners, the difficulty increases; if there are less, go down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mxetn2/understanding_pow/,9,3,1mxetn2,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.9847

2025-08-22 06:43:42+00:00,"is bitcoin really a hedge against inflation? my question to all the experts is that when the money supply inflates, does the price of bitcoin inflate with it?

if the bitcoin price didn’t move a.k.a. more people didn’t put money in it, but the us dollar was increasing in supply, does the price of bitcoin still go up? or does the price of one bitcoin become less valuable?

i’ve heard of people on youtube talk about this and my current opinion is that the only reason bitcoin is a hedge against inflation is because the price goes up and new people put money in it.

i don’t think the bitcoin price holds its value when there is money being printed, but with no new buyers.

2025-08-22 04:08:31+00:00,"wormholes when you first get into these spaces, you’ll see a ton of comments telling people to “study bitcoin” or “do your research.” and if you’re like me, your first reaction is probably
“i just want to make money, i’m not trying to become an economist.”
but i’m here to tell you, in your path in life this is a wormhole you must naturally fall into and unwind.

i got out of the army not too long ago and i’m just a regular guy with no financial background, trying to figure out what my next move in life was. i didn’t go to college. i didn’t come from money. i just knew the system felt rigged, and i needed to find a way out. i’ve always heard about bitcoin since high school. thought it was just internet money at first.
then i started digging.
and next thing you know, i’m deep diving into fiat currency, inflation theory, the federal reserve, austrian economics, and the hard money thesis.
and for the first time, things made sense but it made me upset.

i realized that:
	1.	the dollar isn’t backed by anything but trust
	2.	inflation is a hidden tax on the poor and middle class
	3.	the system is built to inflate debt and dilute your savings
	4.	and bitcoin is the only tool that puts you outside that system

now i see why people say “study it,” because once you do, you can’t unsee it.
you stop thinking of bitcoin as just an asset, and start understanding it as a lifeboat.

i’m not rich. i’m not a whale.
but i’ve shifted my mindset from “get rich quick” to “opt out, build slow, and hold hard.”

if you’re new here and overwhelmed, don’t rush into the price charts or hype tweets.
sit down. study it.
it might just be the most important thing you ever learn.

also any advice on creating discords or group chats with like minded people and weaving out the scum & scammers i’d greatly appreciate it or if anyone knows of any existing great communities outside of reddit i’d appreciate the invite",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mwwl38/wormholes/,69,26,1mwwl38,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.7715

bitcoin has this same issue, sure. but it is the only currency that can make these “gains”, and its core principles remain the same. the main difference has always been how it was launched. bitcoins price only matters for the sake of sound money adoption and getting more eyes on the key issue that plagues most of the world, which is broken money. when bitcoin reaches a million usd, 10million usd, 100million usd, will the dollar amount even matter? does it even matter now as we speak? the only thing that will matter is if you hold something that can’t be debased by anybody else no matter how hard they try. 1 btc = 1 btc, always! 

bitcoin launched fairly, without a pre mine, is borderless, capped at a number in 21million, is open to anybody in the world, anywhere at anytime, and is has network transparency that can be validated by anyone, amongst many other things. a currency with rules without rulers. it basically exists, like gravity, as a tool for us to utilize and build on.

this is where the real change will begin for everyone. no dog, frog, or celebrity meme coin will ever provide a better future for us. only bitcoin can do that. everything else is just noise.

2025-08-21 22:25:44+00:00,"my lost bitcoins got some free btc from friends around 2012ish era using the original bitcoin-qt or however it was called client. around 2013 my hdd of 320gb started to fill up with that + dumb games/movies/music.


me back then: i need something to store those bitcoins but also i needed space on that god-damned hdd. a friend told me about electrum so i was super happy about it. no more gbs for the blockchain but only a seed, passphrase and i'm good to go to transaction if needed. great, i've created the wallet on electrum, moved the coins to the brand new address then i kept my words in a txt on desktop. before proceeding with the reinstallation i was exploring the electrum gui and saw something like ""mpk <something>"" or maybe <something> mpk"" now i don't remember if the word was show mpk or display mpk but i remember something like that. great, let me backup that on google drive and i should be good to go - no, here everything went wrong. since those were gifted by various friends i did not gave to much importance and the years went by until i got a flashback that i had those bitcoins somewhere. i've looked everywhere and finally found the most precious file of my life in a txt on google drive. 


great, let me download electrum, check the checksum to be sure that it's the right thing then i've imported the long string. electrum opened and meanwhile some pop-up alert went on (but when i saw the amount there i closed it without reading it at first), saw the transactions, with a few other txs (very very low amount) then i was ready to withdraw some to x exchange with the idea to gift me a car. issue? i was not able to do anything. broadcast the transaction? nope. after a few moments i noticed the ""watch only"" in the upper left next to electrum. 

~emotional damage~
first phase: angriness and frustration: i started to lookup everywhere for those words, i was thinking that i saved them somewhere or i could recover them or recover the seed from the master public key but nothing, it's... impossible. i've lost weeks, months and all what i did was work; try to recover the lost btc; sleep a few hours then do that again.

second phase: struggling: well this knocked me hard, really hard and i've stopped to lookup for ways to recover those btc. but i think this was the worst phase. literally every nice car that i saw on the streets in my mind i was like ""that could be mine""; the same for the pretty houses around here. i even started to dream a lot of holidays in places that i always wanted to visit, or (small note, i have 2 cats and i take care of lots of stray cats every single day) i even started to dream that i was able to build a huge place for all the stray cats, hire vets and give free apartments for the volunteers helping with the cats. 
but in the morning everything vanished and i had to start working again. 

last phase: acceptance: it's clear that there's no way to recover anything (at least for now, who knows in the future) so it's pointless to waste time on impossible ways to recover anything now.

in this time period, i will not sell any of my bitcoin stack (and i'll only be adding to it), no matter what.  so for 11 years, this bitcoin is completely frozen.  if bitcoin is $1 million/coin i won't sell, if bitcoin falls back to $3k, i won't sell.  no matter what, i'll have the bitcoin that i have (or more) in 11 years time.  it's a personal agreement with myself.  even if something happens in my life, even if a life-threatening event happens, i will take out debt or whatever i need to do to take care of myself and my family, but this bitcoin will not move for any reason.  knowing this in my mind, it gives me the relief to not worry about price or short-term thinking of any governments, corporations, etc.  even if mstr themselves go bankrupt and has to sell all of their bitcoin in a small amount of time and bitcoin literally goes back to $1,000/coin, i won't sell because that's my agreement with myself.

i hope you all can find this kind of clarity with hodling and understand that bitcoin is something that is going to be very volatile in the next few years because it's still a very new concept to people.  i've been in bitcoin for many years and i'm not sure that the majority of people understand it any better than in 2017.  you either get it, or you don't.  really.  it's a difficult concept to understand that inflation doesn't need to happen or that bonds aren't 'rock solid'.  it might be another 10 years for a few more individuals to understand what's really going on in the world.  but know that hodling will pay off and fiat currencies will die.  it's really only a matter of time...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mwgbjl/freeze_hodling_will_set_you_free/,4,8,1mwgbjl,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9663

for me, this is exactly what i look for. i don’t see weakness here, i see accumulation. it’s like the calm before the storm. after the halving, things usually take a while before momentum picks up, and that’s exactly where we are now.

i’ve been slowly stacking during this “boring” phase. no chasing pumps, no stress, just dollar-cost averaging and holding. i’d rather load up when everyone’s distracted than try to fomo in once bitcoin starts breaking new levels.

the way i see it, bitcoin isn’t just holding up well, it’s setting the stage. and when it finally moves, i don’t think it’s going to be small.

process is below:  
open wallet - convert dollars to btc - send btc to recipient - convert back into desired currency and back into bank account of individual(s)

2025-08-21 15:32:52+00:00,"a shortcut to understanding what 1 btc = 1 btc really means imagine living in central africa centuries ago. your village uses seashells (let's call them usd) for trade. they’re rare, brought in from distant shores, and have long been the primary store of value and means of exchange in your local economy. they break and get lost occasionally, but new shells brought in from far away more than make up for this by inflating the local total slowly overtime to keep a balanced perceived scarcity, allowing them to work as local a decent store of value and currency.

one day, foreigners arrive with a shiny yellow metal called gold (this represents bitcoin). at first, it’s a curiosity... your economy isn’t built around it. but some people begin trading seashells (usd) for gold (btc). others follow. the value of gold (btc) in terms of seashells (usd) rises. this causes more volatility and interest in the new thing.

since everything is still priced in seashells (usd), you naturally track how much gold (btc) is worth *in seashells (usd)*. that’s your frame of reference.

then, you discover something important (call it an insight): these foreigners can bring in *lots* of seashells (printing of usd will accelerate in the future)... much more than your local community ever could. suddenly, seashells (usd), in your mind, are no longer as scarce as you once believed. they're easier to get... even printable, in a sense... and that threatens their value. most don't see this, but it's becoming more clear to you as a risk to your store of value.

this realization shifts your thinking.

you begin to see that gold (bitcoin), not seashells (usd), is the better store of value. it’s scarce, durable, and secure... while seashells (usd) are becoming inflated and less reliable for preserving your wealth. most around you don't see this yet, and your local economy still uses seashells for everything, but you have an edge here.

at this point, you stop thinking in terms of “how much gold (btc) can i get for my seashells (usd)?” and instead start asking, “how many seashells (usd) is this amount of gold (btc) worth now?” this is a eureka moment. a profound realization. you’re no longer concerned with gold's (btc) price in seashells (usd)... you’re tracking the seashell’s (usd) value *in gold*. (btc)

you continue living your daily life... still using seashells because that’s what the local economy runs on. but you begin converting any seashells (usd) you don’t immediately need into gold (btc), quietly building your savings in this superior asset, while others are still thinking of it just as a speculative way to get more seashells (usd) on the other end.

eventually, others will come to the same realization. and as more people shift their thinking, the pricing standard itself will change. that’s when you understand: **1 btc = 1 btc.** 

the value represented in seashells (usd) that you followed all that time was really gold (btc) slowly consuming the old way of thinking and taking over the frame of reference. that inevitably, eventually thing of value will be valued in gold (btc) and the total supply of seashells (usd) will be a subset of that total value at some point in the future... because there are also other things of value out there, we only think of them as priced in usd because that's our frame of reference. when that flips... you will wish you traded any amount of seashells (usd) for any small amount of gold (btc)... seashells will be a relic, and not a representation of value in the market once that flip happens: 1 btc = 1 btc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mweagg/a_shortcut_to_understanding_what_1_btc_1_btc/,14,13,1mweagg,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9965

beyond its symbolic meaning, bitcoin infinity day is also associated with a unique creation known as the infinity day keys. a bitcoiner and artist that goes by the pseudonym fractalencrypt created the infinity day keys to help spread the meme created by knut svanholm, ""bitcoin: everything there is divided by 21 million"" and the original article that knut released on august 21, 2020, titled ""[deeper down the rabbit hole](https://www.citadel21.com/deeper-down-the-rabbit-hole)"". as a sidenote, knut says that he did not intentionally publish his original article on august 21, 2020 and that it was just a coincidence. 

knut svanhold was the first person to receive one of the infinity day keys. [this is a photo of knut svanhold holding his infinity day key.](https://i.redd.it/i14vsg45mckf1.png)

i kept reading about it the following years. my everything was so focused on law school, i did not allow myself to learn about bitcoin, afraid it would distract me from school. 

i put myself through an emotional hell for school. in my country you can only take the bar twice. i failed the exams. 

now i am not a lawyer, single and unfortunately have been sick for the past two years. 

i could really use a break. and i can't stop fantasizing, that had i invested, i could retire and finally have a break from life. it hurts, it's all i think about.

2025-08-20 21:09:06+00:00,"gold is aesthetically unattractive there are a number of fallacious arguments made by goldbugs that never seem to get addressed in the global discourse. one assertion in particular has pecked my eyeballs and eardrums too many times recently without adequate retort – the idea that gold is aesthetically beautiful.

this argument arrives in various forms. 

sometimes it's overt – ""gold is valuable because it's beautiful.""

other times it's subtle – ""gold is valuable because it's used in jewelry."" the implication is that gold is worn because it possesses a unique visual allure which is self-evident and intrinsic. it's assumed the value of gold is partially derived from this intrinsic beauty, rather than the perceived beauty being a construct of the notional value.

even more subtle is the suggestion that gold is ""god's money."" the implication here is that god himself made all the scarce metals a boring shiny grey color – except one – which he made shiny yellow. he blessed just one metal with a quality that is uniquely captivating to the human eye so that we'd all instinctively understand it to be timelessly true money, as decreed by the omniscience, omnipotent,  omnipresent creator of the universe.

...

ok, except...

humans obviously do not find gold-colored things aesthetically pleasing.

we drive silver / shiny grey colored cars en masse. almost nobody drives a gold colored car. if anyone does drive a gold colored car, it's universally acknowledged to be tacky.

we erect shimmering silvery buildings and infrastructure all over the world. nobody builds gold colored buildings. damn it... even the golden gate bridge was painted orangey red.

look around people's apartments or your workplace or the local cafe. all sorts of things are artificially made a shiny grey / silvery color – door handles, cupboard handles, chest of drawer handles, suit jackets, shoes, the flush button on the toilet etc. it's very easy to make these things gold colored, but few people would want them.

ask a fashion expert. they'll tell you it's much easier to co-ordinate a visually appealing outfit with silver than it is with gold.

if you're still not convinced, let's take a closer look at jewelry. white gold (i.e. silver colored gold) is the most popular form of engagement / wedding band. people are making their gold jewelry silver colored en masse. absolutely nobody is making their silver or platinum jewelry gold colored.

gold is not aesthetically pleasing. the jewelers are making it silver coloured. the fashionistas refuse to work with it. the architects scoff at the suggestion of incorporating it into their buildings. the car manufacturers make cars that are every other colour under the sun.

if copper was rare and gold was plentiful, goldbugs would undoubtedly be espousing the undeniable beauty of shiny orange.

gold is not a gift from god. if god gave you anything, it was a brain with which to reason. gold is aesthetically unattractive – and people only thought otherwise because they were allowing its reputation as a signifier of wealth to influence their aesthetic judgement. that reputation is underpinned fundamentally by the fact that it is the hardest and soundest store of value humanity has ever discovered.

except... it isn't the hardest and soundest store of value humanity has ever discovered anymore. bitcoin is. what do you think happens next?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mvrfix/gold_is_aesthetically_unattractive/,0,15,1mvrfix,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9906

i'm 99% sure there's nothing in it, but might as well try.

\# - found 1 possible wallet

\# - found 7 possible encrypted keys

\# - keys require manual decryption due to crypter stability issues

\# next steps:

\# 1. the wallet file appears to be encrypted

\# 2. key positions have been identified and saved in the json file

i remember the audience who all seemed to be highly educated bunch started booing the idea and there was visceral gasp.

  
just then the executive says - your private thoughts are not captured - only public thoughts but everyone (in comments) argued that once you can read the thoughts through brain sync/scan without permission - there is nothing called a private thought.

  
i couldn't shake off the creepiness of that thought.

  
for some reason, i thought of it again but in the context of bitcoin and seed phrases.  for those who remember these by-heart in their minds - what happens if such a technology becomes mainstream?

2025-08-19 17:25:28+00:00,"1971 broke money 1971 — nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 — us debt explodes  
1971 — wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 — dollar = debt  
1971 — petrodollar born  
1971 — families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 — women pushed to work (“liberation”)

1971 didn’t change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it’s $34 trillion.

that’s not growth. that’s theft—paid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year… for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education—everything essential—started outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of “liberation.” but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me…

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 — federal reserve created  
1913 — income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed’s scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn’t lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don’t serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn’t just blood + bombs. it’s debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq… all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that’s how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
🔹 us national debt → $400b → $34t+  
🔹 inflation steals \~97% of the dollar’s value  
🔹 wealth gap explodes  
🔹 the “american dream” dies for most families  
🔹 dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don’t hold cash. they hold assets—real estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you’re told to “save” while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can’t be repaid and the system collapses.

that’s why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today’s chaos…  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

· for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
· for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

2025-08-19 05:33:10+00:00,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we’ve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the “ wen lambo” crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

if i had a chance to go deeper i would ask a person what work is. and explain how humanity literally expends their life force to get money. nothing is more valuable than a persons life. therefore when a government prints money they are committing an unpardonable sin. devaluing the life force of humanity.

i convinced her that bitcoin was a good idea however old you are. i advised her to spend on bitcoin what she would normally fritter away on her amazon delivery addiction. i got her set up on an exchange and she started saving. within 12 months she'd put in around 2k.
she then lost her password, then her email account and then dropped her phone in the toilet. all these things meant she was locked out for a while.
a few days ago, almost 12 months after being locked out of her account i managed to get her access to the bitcoin and everything sorted. 
anyway, the new outlook she has for life and the smile on her face now that she has well over 7k to play with makes me happy. she's now booking a holiday and making other plans that were not feasible 12 months ago. 
she's also started buying more bitcoin. £25 a week. 
she possibly won't be around to see bitcoin take over the world but it's already made a big difference to hers.

but whenever i zoom out, i always end up back at the same place: **bitcoin**. it’s not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. yet, it’s the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every “bitcoin is dead” article.

what keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. a decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. i can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone’s permission. in times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

of course, the price volatility can be wild. i’ve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. for me, it’s less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

the important point here is this:

he already bought,  and tat means that he won't be buying more for a while. that means he won't be supporting the price anymore (until a few weeks later).

so this is a signal for automated bots, short term traders and speculators, to dump on this partial top, since it's a very safe bet the price won't be as supported in the coming days or weeks.

also, they know that probably will cause a cascade o liquidation of leveraged longs. 

so when mr. saylor puts out that tweet it's the best time to dump and short bitcoin.

i'm a bitcoin bull an maxi. and this info is so you can buy cheap right now.

of the fatal inconsistencies in saifedean ammous' bitcoin standard  
  
in the previous essay ([bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1mrl65c/bitcoin_most_certainly_violates_mises_regression/)) we ended with statements by mises that his (austrian) school of thought ""praxeology"" rejects empirical (think archeological) based arguments and only accepts arguments extended from reason.

here we will show countless examples of saifedean ammous, a purported austrian economics professor relying on empirical based points and arguments trying to make his conclusion about the economic implications of bitcoin.

in this essay i use the perspective and intention of szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with mises regression theorem, to highlight saifedean ammous’ nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including mises, hayek, and nash as well as implicitly szabo and satoshi.

further i highlight that saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to jo walton, “the analogy between bitcoin and yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.“

this essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‘un-wrapped’ using szabonian deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as and money-like things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyj25tQYJck&list=PL_VzRSPfA1fvllWWum1lU-EqBXt1kCqSk,7,11,1mt78dw,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5839

for example, if alice sends 1 btc to bob, i want to know step by step:

* how transactions are created and signed with private/public keys
* how they’re broadcast to the network and stored in mempool
* how miners pick transactions and form a block
* how the nonce is generated and tested against the target difficulty
* who decides/assigns this target value (and how difficulty adjusts)
* how proof of work ensures consensus
* how the block is validated by other nodes and added to the chain
* how immutability is maintained (e.g., why changing one block breaks the whole chain)

(https://x.com/soaker\_patoshi)

in the previous essay ([bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1mrl65c/bitcoin_most_certainly_violates_mises_regression/)) we ended with statements by mises that his (austrian) school of thought ""praxeology"" rejects empirical (think archeological) based arguments and only accepts arguments extended from reason. 

here we will show countless examples of saifedean ammous, a purported austrian economics professor relying on empirical based points and arguments trying to make his conclusion about the economic implications of bitcoin. 

in this essay i use the perspective and intention of szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with mises regression theorem, to highlight saifedean ammous’ nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including mises, hayek, and nash as well as implicitly szabo and satoshi.  
  
further i highlight that saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to jo walton, “the analogy between bitcoin and yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.“  
  
this essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‘un-wrapped’ using szabonian deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as and money-like things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).

anyway, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how many people keep their bitcoin on exchanges and i'm on about considerable amounts because i know some of you will say ""no point self custodying if you only have £25 and a dream"", but lets be honest if you think that kind of bag is your key to an early retirement then please, treat yourself to a cold wallet and maybe a tattoo on your forehead that reads ""tell me to buy more bitcoin"". on a serious note, how many of you actually read the t&c's when signing up to an exchange? i didn't, but there will also be things that say:

""we reserve the right to suspend withdrawals""

""insolvency may result in partial or total loss of funds""

""in the event of catastrophic failure, we'll send you an automated email with the word ""unfortunately"" and picture of us sipping cocktails funded by everyone who lost their money""

we all know things like this has happened before which is why i'm hoping to at least give one person a sign to finally getting around to ordering that hardware wallet. i also find it a lot easier to hold on to my sats as its a whole ""thing"" to actually get around to liquidating. i do definitely sleep better knowing i'm the only person who has access to my funds and in that worst case scenario, global meltdown, we only need one bitcoiner to keep his node running and we can send some to the local prepper who is selling beans out of his garage.

so if you've got a hardware wallet sat in your shopping basket (the manufactures website of course) then see this as your sign to buy it, just make sure your keys are somewhere secure because its very easy to go half arsed with it at first but when your bag grows and your security doesnt, you're playing with fire.

it’s not just about price action (though watching btc grind back toward new levels is exciting on its own). it’s the way the community around it has matured. you don’t see the same level of blind hype like in 2017 or even 2021. instead, i notice more people talking about *why* they’re holding, how they’re using it, and what role bitcoin actually plays in their long-term plans.

for me, i’ve been stacking slowly, nothing crazy, just consistent dca. what surprises me most is how many of the people i talk to, friends, colleagues, even family, are starting to take bitcoin seriously. not as a quick trade, but as something with actual staying power.

i’m curious though… how’s everyone here approaching btc right now?

""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises’ axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn’t declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo’s work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,8,40,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions—like fear and greed—that those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

i truly believe in the short to medium term there will be some sort of systemic shock, a point when the debt we have collected has come due and becomes untenable to pay it. some institutions and even countries have seen it by buying hard assets like gold, bitcoin and even stakes in companies or land. my question is, if you were a banker how would you see your institution trying to work with it? self custody a butt ton of btc and back accounts with it? buy gold? strategy shares or options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mqyzx7/game_time_if_you_were_a_banker_how_would_you/,42,67,1mqyzx7,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.3954

2025-08-15 10:16:06+00:00,"google invests in bitcoin mining firm through $3.7 billion partnership google's recent investment in bitcoin miner terawulf is a strategic move, not a direct bet on bitcoin. as part of a larger $3.7 billion, 10-year deal, google is acquiring an 8% equity stake in the company. this isn't about entering the crypto mining business; it's about securing essential infrastructure for the booming ai sector.

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

following my last reddit post and your advice, i’ve changed my approach to self-custody.

check out my new paranoid setup:

i have a hidden bitcoin knots full node (running over tor) on a small home server.

on a bootable usb stick, i use tails os with no data persistence, and sparrow wallet installs automatically at every startup.
this sparrow wallet connects to my node to see and send transactions. it’s a 2-of-3 multisig with three physical hardware wallets.
each seed is engraved on a metal plate, with each one stored in a different location, extremely well hidden. a family member knows the location of one, my wife knows another, and my son knows the last one (and i know all three). they’re fully aware of the absolute necessity of never mentioning them to anyone under any circumstances, and a detailed procedure explaining how to recover the funds will be sent to them upon my death.

to maximize privacy, i have another single-sig hardware wallet that serves as a hot wallet. that’s the one that receives btc purchases from exchanges, and from there i send the funds on-chain to my true cold wallet, using a different public key each time.

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time. 

  
i plan on mainly hodling, with possibly making 1-2 trades every few years if i feel like playing with the cycles.

the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin. **this strategy not only strengthens profusa’s balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company’s prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa’s commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.** this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa’s leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa’s bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

not “like” electricity… but behaving *as* electricity in an engineering sense:

* **btc = electrons** — the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** — the push that drives the current.
* **miners = generators** — converting real-world energy into unforgeable monetary signal.
* **financial instruments (like mstr’s capital stack) = circuit components** — switches, resistors, capacitors, magnetic fields… each shaping or routing the bitcoin current in a unique way.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it’s not a stock, not a company — it’s the base layer of a new monetary grid.

i put together a full write-up here with diagrams:

it is necessary to understand what potential all these instruments have. the first group has limited potential. the second group has more potential in % than the first, and the third, in theory, has more than all the previous ones, but it all depends on whether the influx of liquidity into these instruments will come at the end of the cycle, because there is no money, no growth, purchases are needed and interest in these instruments, but for now the influx is possible in what in practice shows priority over these years.

2025-08-22 02:51:39+00:00,"[altcoin season 2025] why september marks the crypto market shift **altcoin season 2025** is approaching, and september could be the turning point investors have been waiting for. the outlook for q3 2025 remains bright, though the emphasis has shifted slightly. just a few months ago, the market focused heavily on bitcoin-led strength, but now **""september could mark the real beginning of the altcoin market""** is gaining traction.

altcoin season, simply put, refers to when three out of four of the top 50 altcoins outperform bitcoin over a three-month period. while we haven't reached this threshold yet, recent trends are gradually tilting in that direction.

there has been much debate about whether the fed's september rate cut marked the market peak. however, the market still has significant **'hidden liquidity'**.

 

[money market fund cumulative total and flows chart from 2021 to 2025 showing record $7 trillion levels](https://preview.redd.it/yqgh1s2hchkf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=762a954fde9a1c4d9d1355fe09bcb5d66bdf1d66)

 

notably, over $7 trillion is locked in money market funds alone. mmfs are ultra-short-term financial products where people safely park their money, and they're currently at record levels. if this massive capital starts moving in search of higher yields after rate cuts, it could flow into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. in april, $150 billion exited mmfs, coinciding with significant rallies in crypto and stock markets. since june, mmf balances have increased by over $200 billion again, yet cryptocurrency prices continued their upward trajectory. typically, when mmf cash increases, crypto takes a breather, but this opposite movement signals that more money could enter the market ahead.

ethereum is playing a pivotal role in this phase. since early july, total altcoin market cap has grown over 50% to reach $1.4 trillion.

 

[altcoin season index chart showing index at 40 level with altcoin market cap growth from may to august 2025](https://preview.redd.it/d5o6n4hnchkf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5befd0efddf45c9efc3250d59944f53201eda3)

 

yet, the 'altseason index' tracked by coinmarketcap remains low at around 40. this means while not officially in altseason territory, funds are already moving with eth at the center. behind this lies institutional demand. interest in digital asset treasuries, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization has repositioned eth from a simple cryptocurrency to core infrastructure for traditional finance.

bitmine emergent technologies has secured 1.15 million eth and plans to raise up to $20 billion more to increase holdings. sharplink gaming holds approximately 600,000 eth. the top few institutions alone hold about 2.95 million eth, exceeding 2% of total supply.

 

[ldo\/usdt price chart showing bullish pattern formation and 1.5x volatility compared to eth](https://preview.redd.it/gk8x22drchkf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=570f8ea64743bd376e8a252983dace4ce3f933f5)

during this process, individual altcoin movements have diverged. while arb, ena, and op showed greater volatility than eth, ldo actually benefited most from eth's rise. lido is the leading platform where anyone can easily earn staking rewards by depositing ethereum. ldo's price gained significant momentum after the sec recently stated **""under certain conditions, highly liquid staking tokens won't be considered securities.""**

currently, ldo exhibits about 1.5x the volatility of eth. this means greater upside potential but also faster declines. however, investors should note that the sec's position is merely staff-level interpretation and could change in future litigation or commission-level decisions.

 

[bitcoin dominance forecast chart showing projected decline from current 59&#37; to 42&#37; target level](https://preview.redd.it/qf3kasb5jhkf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=52580abaee8be338cff17eb2f802fcd91fb4feaa)

 

bitcoin dominance decreased from 65% in may to 59% in august. this signals some market funds are shifting toward altcoins. despite the sharp increase in altcoin market cap, the still-low index **might suggest we're in the preliminary stages of a full altseason.**

macroeconomic conditions point in the same direction. considering past cases where global m2 money supply led bitcoin prices by about 110 days, **liquidity could increase significantly in late q3 and early q4.** this wave of money will particularly impact the retail-driven altcoin market. while institutions still focus on major coins like bitcoin and ethereum, retail funds predominantly flow into altcoins.

internal market indicators also show positive changes. liquidity metrics combining stablecoin issuance, spot trading volume, perpetual futures volume, and order volume have stopped their six-month decline and recently showed recovery. increasingly clear regulations are also facilitating capital inflows.

# 

in summary, the market is in a transitional phase from bitcoin's solo performance to an expanded stage including altcoins. bitcoin dominance is declining, institutional demand centered on eth is growing, funds locked in mmfs are preparing to unlock, and stablecoin issuance is increasing. as these factors converge, september likely marks the beginning of a proper altcoin season. this trend deserves attention as a structural shift aligned with macroeconomic policies and institutional changes, rather than a brief rally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mwv2rd/altcoin_season_2025_why_september_marks_the/,27,24,1mwv2rd,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9975

crypto, on the other hand, still is not widely used for anything practical.  its only mainstream use is as a speculative asset, and the only other things it has contributed to society are inspiring meme investing culture (trading cards and memestocks), spawning some of the stupidest assets in history (nfts and dog coins), and being used for scams.

2025-08-21 12:05:24+00:00,"10+ years in this space; 3 important lessons i have learnt. 
- ignorance is the greatest risk. 
- greed is an important ingredient to succeed. 
- everyone has an agenda. 

# ignorance. 
ignorance in the cryptocurrency market can be devastating, leading to missed opportunities or the loss of life savings or even both. unlike traditional assets, crypto is highly volatile and complex. while cryptocurrencies volatility in general can be seen as a blessing in disguise, lacking knowledge in this space can expose you to a range of risks, from market manipulation [do kwon, sbf; ring any bells?] to technological failures and scams.

### the cost of ignorance: missed opportunities. 

the crypto market has seen incredible growth and volatility over the last five years, presenting unique investment windows that could have yielded significant returns for informed investors, contributors, day traders or holders like me. 

* **bitcoin (btc):** in early 2020, bitcoin was trading below $10,000. by late 2021, it had reached a new all-time high of over $68k. anyone with even a dollar who understood the market cycles, halving events, and increasing institutional adoption would have recognized the bullish signals and capitalized on this impending bullrun. ignorance would have led them to either dismiss it as a fad or be too scared to make a move, resulting to a missed opportunity.

* **ethereum (eth):** ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a similar trajectory. in 2020, eth was hovering around $130 to $140. its price surged dramatically, hitting an all-time high of over $4,800 in late 2021. this was driven by the rise of decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (nfts) *[though it seems like everyone has forgotten about nfts in big 2025, the big names in nft like **bored ape** are still standing strong which is a testament to the relevance of how a properly themed nft can stand the test of time]**, which are built on the ethereum network. sadly, many were ignorant of these developments and as a  byproduct failed to recognize the immense potential of eth till this day.

* **binance coin (bnb):** bnb, the native token of the binance exchange, was valued at around $17 in early 2020. though i wasn't a beneficiary, binance [the exchange] even did an event and gave away bnb for free. by may 2021, it had skyrocketed to over $680 and currently trading above $800, **[not an investment advice, but we might see bnb over $1k+ before the end of 2025]**. this growth was fueled by the popularity of the binance smart chain and the utility of the bnb token within the binance ecosystem. without understanding the underlying technology and use cases of bnb and the importance of a cex like binance [still not a fan of cex in general though], anyone that is uninformed would have been completely blind to this opportunity.

### the cost of ignorance: losing your savings. 

beyond missed opportunities, ignorance can directly lead to the loss of your entire savings like i experienced at one time.

* **falling for scams:** the crypto space is rife with ""pump-and-dump"" schemes, rug pulls, and fraudulent projects. uninformed investors, often swayed by social media hype and the fear of missing out (fomo), may invest their savings in a project without doing any research (due diligence). they fail to check the team behind the project, the tokenomics, or the actual utility, only to watch the project builders disappear with their funds. how i manage my research into a project is by focusing on the utility and the tokenomics of the project. broadening the research scope can lead to more problems than solutions. 

* **emotional trading:** the crypto market is notoriously volatile like i previously mentioned. prices can swing wildly in a matter of hours. some traders often make decisions based on emotion rather than a sound strategy. when the market dips, they panic-sell at a loss. when the market is surging, they buy at the peak, only to see the value plummet. this emotional, reactive behavior is a recipe for financial ruin.

* **security risks:** many have lost their funds not from a bad investment, but from poor security practices. ignorance of how to properly secure a wallet, protect private keys, and avoid phishing scams can result in losing all their holdings to bad actors and opportunist. unlike traditional bank accounts, there is **no central authority to reverse a stolen crypto transaction.**

# greed.
the conventional wisdom often portrays greed as a **negative force,** leading to reckless decisions and financial ruin. however, in the context of high-risk, high-reward markets like cryptocurrency, a certain kind of ""greed"" can be a crucial ingredient for success. this isn't about blind, impulsive avarice, but rather a calculated desire for exceptional gains that can drive anyone to make strategic, contrarian moves.

billionaire warren buffett once said, ""be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" this statement perfectly encapsulates the kind of calculated greed that can lead to success in crypto and i have taken this advice to heart for my finances [i am still poor incase anyone was wondering]. when the market is in a state of ""extreme fear,"" prices are low, and most people often **panick sell** thier otherwise valuable assets. a savvy investor, driven by a desire for significant returns, sees this as a prime opportunity.

here's how this ""greedy when others are fearful"" mindset has played out with specific cryptocurrencies:

* **polkadot (dot):** during bear markets or periods of low sentiment, polkadot's price can plummet alongside the rest of the market. an investor driven by ""greed"" would not be swayed by the overall market fear. instead, they would research polkadot's fundamental value—its multichain architecture, its development team, and its potential for interoperability in the web3 space [zetablockchain cross-chain interoperability comes to mind here]. their ""greed"" for future gains would motivate them to acquire dot at a discounted price, betting on its long-term success. when the market eventually recovers and polkadot's technology gains more adoption, their is a big chance for their early investment to yield high returns.

* **chainlink (link):** i have been a huge fan of chainlink ever since i got to study it's underlying infrastructure/utility. chainlink's value is tied to its role as a decentralized oracle network, providing real-world data to smart contracts. this utility is a core part of the crypto ecosystem. when the overall crypto market dips, many investors might sell off assets like link without understanding its critical function. the ""greedy"" investor, however, would recognize that chainlink's value proposition remains intact regardless of **short-term market fluctuations.** they would use the price drop as an opportunity to accumulate more link at a lower cost, positioning themselves to profit as the network's adoption grows.

* **uniswap (uni):** as a leading decentralized exchange, uniswap is a cornerstone of the defi (decentralized finance) movement. its native token, uni, experienced significant volatility. a greedy investor would not be deterred by a crash in the price of uni. they would understand that the demand for decentralized trading and liquidity is a long-term trend. their desire for outsized returns would prompt them to buy uni when others are fearful, knowing that a recovery would be driven by the continued growth and usage of the uniswap protocol.

* **xrp (ripple):** xrp's price has been heavily influenced by its legal battles with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec). this ongoing uncertainty has caused major price swings and periods of extreme fear among investors. however, an investor with a calculated ""greed"" might view this as a unique opportunity. they would research the legal case, the utility of xrp in cross-border payments, and the potential for a favorable resolution. their conviction, born from the desire for a massive payout, would lead them to invest when others are selling due to fear. if the legal case is resolved in ripple's favor, such an investment could lead to extraordinary profits [which of course turned out to be the case]. 

in these examples, ""greed"" is not a reckless, emotion-driven force. it's the fuel for a contrarian, long-term investment strategy. it's the desire to go against the herd, to see that tiny glimpse of light in the dark, to buy when the market sentiment is at its worst, and to patiently wait for the inevitable recovery. this kind of calculated greed, combined with thorough research and a deep understanding of the underlying technology, is what separates those who make life-changing gains from those who are simply caught up in the **emotional swings of the market.**

# the agenda. 
every actor in the cryptocurrency space, from developers and project founders to influencers and marketers, operates with **an agenda.** this is not inherently a negative thing, as an ""agenda"" can be a driving force for innovation and community building. however, it's crucial  to understand these agendas, as they can also be a source of risk and misinformation.

### the good and the bad agendas

an agenda is simply a plan or motive behind an action. in the crypto world, these agendas can be categorized as good or bad, often falling on a spectrum.

**good agendas:**
* **innovation and adoption:** many developers and founders have the agenda of creating a new, decentralized technology that solves a real-world problem. their agenda is to build a robust, secure, and useful network.
* **education and community building:** some influencers and content creators are genuinely **passionate about blockchain technology and have an agenda to educate the public.** they aim to demystify complex topics, share valuable insights, and foster a healthy, informed community.
* **legitimate marketing:** a project's marketing team has the agenda of increasing brand awareness and attracting users. when done ethically, this involves highlighting the project's unique features, roadmap, and use cases to a relevant audience like zetachain is actively doing.

**bad agendas:**
* **financial exploitation:** this is the most dangerous type of agenda. it involves promoting a cryptocurrency with the sole purpose of inflating its price so the promoter can sell their holdings for a profit. this is often seen in **""pump-and-dump"" schemes**.
* **deception and misinformation:** some influencers and marketers may have an agenda to spread false or exaggerated information about a project to generate hype. they may conceal their paid promotions, leading their followers to believe they are giving an unbiased endorsement.
* **reckless speculation:** while not malicious, some agendas are simply careless. an influencer might promote a memecoin with no real utility, simply because it's a trend, while this is not wrong in a general sense as memecoins are often born from *viral trends*, unfortunately, giving a false promise of utility in the future can lead followers to invest in a highly volatile and risky memecoin based on hype rather than fundamentals.

### the grim situation with influencers and memecoins.

the rise of influencers and the proliferation of memecoins have created a particularly grim situation, where the lines between good and bad agendas are often blurred. before anyone take a big swing at me for my mention of memecoins, i am a big fan of memecoins and currently contributing to the development of one i genuinely believe will change how **people see memecoins.** 

* **lack of disclosure:** one of the most significant ethical issues is the failure of influencers to disclose paid partnerships. an influencer might post about a memecoin, creating the illusion that they are a true believer, when in reality they have been paid to promote it. this deceives their audience and can lead to significant financial losses.

* **""moral"" endorsements with malicious intent:** in some cases, an influencer might claim they are ""just having fun"" or ""betting on a long shot,"" framing their promotion of a memecoin **as a harmless gamble**. however, their real agenda is to generate enough hype to cause a price surge, allowing them to sell their position at the top before the price inevitably crashes. the grim reality is that their followers, who are often less experienced, are left holding the **worthless token.**

* **marketing over substance:** the agendas of memecoin promoters are often centered on virality rather than utility. they understand that these coins succeed based on community hype and marketing, not on the underlying technology. this leads them to use manipulative tactics like creating fake social media buzz, launching coordinated marketing campaigns, and leveraging the fear of missing out (fomo) to attract new investors.

in conclusion, while not every agenda is bad, every individual in the crypto space has one. one must become aware of these agendas and learn to differentiate between those who genuinely want to add value to the ecosystem and those who are simply looking to profit from the ignorance of others. the grim situation with influencers and memecoins serves as a critical warning: if you are investing based on someone else's recommendation, you need to first understand their agenda. if their agenda is simply to make a quick buck, then *their success will come at the expense of your own.*

i had multiple text messages saying my kucoin account had a compromise or that someone is trying to withdraw and if it wasn't me then i should call this number. i ignored it multiple times as i knew it was a scam but after getting so many texts figured i will call them and fuck with them and take their time a bit.

the guy who picked up had a british accent and he said that i had a login from an iphone in india and asked if it was me? from this point on i played along as best as i could and i thought i will take it as long as i can. they asked me to log in to my kucoin account to check if i have my money and they asked of course what is the amount. i lied something absurd, i said all of my 16 btc and 22.5 eth is still available lol (i have max 100usdt on my account). you could hear their muffled reaction like yess they got the big catch hahah. 

from this point they made me download a trust wallet app and they gave me a seed phrase and made me log into their wallet with 0$ on it. they said this was a security wallet and i need to transfer all my funds from kucoin to here. i was hesitating and asking a lot of questions to make it believable. he then guided me  all through kucoin and how to transfer my eth, he said now transfer half of your eth and i stopped and asked what, why half? will the other half be lost?? and he said immediatley ""ahh no then do max, do all of it""🤣. 

so then i bluffed that the transfer was complete but i don't see it on the trust wallet app. he said that he doesn't see the transaction on the ethereum network. i was playing dumb for a while and i said i even got a confirmation in the transaction history. at this point i asked him just to see how far i can take this, ""could you like send some money on to the trust wallet to check if its working?"". he said naah no way man not how it works etc and then after waiting a while and making me triple check, he made me hold the line for 10 mins and he came back and said he sent 5 dollars to the wallet and i should check. 

it was there so, of course i immediately transferred it to my account and told him that this was the worst scam i have ever seen and laughed my ass off.😂 he got pissed as hell told me to fuck off and said i have too much time on my hands and that after we hang up, he will make 10s of thousands scamming people and that he got all my details. which when i asked about he couldn't really recall hahah. what a freaking team of losers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mvstem/i_just_scammed_a_crypto_scammer/,1455,162,1mvstem,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,-0.9852

**snapshots always taken on first of the month (data below reflects 1 aug snapshot).**

* **july highlights:** all green month, **eth** and **xrp** lead the way.  overall, **btc** dropped from 1st place to 3rd, now trailing behind **xrp** and **tron.**  the class of 2025 has almost clawed itself back to even, but is still the worst performing of the eight top ten experiment portfolios.
* dca'ing once a year into top ten cryptos for the last 8 years has produced much better returns than if you'd done the same with the s&p 500 over the same time period (+342% vs s&p500's +71% - see below for details).

# month seven – down -0.4%

https://preview.redd.it/ahf5fdjsd6kf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=261835270bbb7fd8d7aab3e34b6854626247b878

the 2025 top ten crypto index fund portfolio is **btc, eth, xrp, bnb, sol, doge, usdc, ada, tron, avax.**

july highlights for the 2025 top ten portfolio:

* all green month
* **eth** and **xrp** outperform the field in july
* seven months into 2025, six cryptos are in positive territory

# july ranking

here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 top ten index fund experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/8pvpyfttd6kf1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=afb5273cf2908ba4137bba0fbbc8bfe3197be2a7

seven months into 2025, not much movement besides **avax:** it has dropped out of the top ten and inching closer to top 20 territory.

# july winners and losers

***july winners*** – **eth** (+46%) achieved its highest monthly gain of 2025 followed by **xrp** (+37%), which logged its best month since january.

***july losers*** – **btc’s** \+8% wasn’t enough to keep it out of last place this month.

# overall update: xrp and tron leapfrog btc, portfolio at break even point, avax and doge in last place

**xrp’s** solid month helped it jump from third to first place.  **xrp** now holds a commanding ytd lead (+38%) over second place **tron** (+27%). **btc** is in third place at +22%.  four cryptos are still underwater since january 2025, including last place **avax** (-40%).

the initial $100 invested in first place **xrp** seven months ago is worth $138 today.

ytd the 2025 top ten portfolio has almost broken even, down -0.4%.  the last time the 2025 top ten portfolio was in positive territory was the end of [january](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)). 

# overall return on $1,000 investment since january 1st, 2025:

the 2025 top ten portfolio gained $172 in july, its largest month over month gain of the year.  the initial $1000 investment on new year’s day 2025 is now worth **$996**, excruciatingly close to breakeven point.

# 2025 top ten portfolio vs. coinbase’s coin50

the first top ten crypto experiment was started on 1 january 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like i do for my experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

this year’s friendly competition is between the 2025 top ten portfolio and the coinbase 50 index **(coin50)**.  **coin50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

on 1 january 2025, **coin50** was valued at $450.54.  here’s the snapshot, seven months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/y9r0zbf3e6kf1.png?width=210&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a0fe696207be583fc8ab0707b78d46bf70ae076

**july performances:**

* **the 2025 top ten portfolio**: +21% 
* **coin50**: +22%

the july monthly victory goes to: **coin50** (its fourth monthly victory in a row)

**overall since january 1st, 2025:** 

* **the 2025 top ten portfolio**: -0.4%
* **coin50**: +5%

overall lead:  **coin50**

for the more visual, here’s the table i’m using to track the friendly top ten vs. **coin50** competition this year:

# combining the 2018 – 2025 top ten crypto portfolios 

the 2025 top ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  so, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the top ten crypto index fund experiments?

* 2018 top ten experiment: up +80% (total value $1,804)
* 2019 top ten experiment: up +847% (total value $9,474)
* 2020 top ten experiment: up +1109% (total value $12,086) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 top ten experiment: up +403% (total value $5,025)
* 2022 top ten experiment: down +2% (total value $1,019)
* 2023 top ten experiment: up +216% (total value $3,156)
* 2024 top ten experiment: up +78% (total value $1,780)
* 2025 top ten experiment: down -0.4% (total value $966) ( ***worst performing portfolio****)*

taking the eight portfolios together:

**after a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 top ten cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$35,340.**

https://preview.redd.it/ongar9d7e6kf1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=23cddfcbf07e15147ffb60432546b8487ffa849f

**that’s up +342%** on the combined portfolios. the peak for the combined top ten index fund experiment portfolios was [**november 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

here’s the combined monthly roi since i started tracking the metric in january 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/keutvw98e6kf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca287c079005ff1d8b676e9975493df11c1e29f

in summary: ***that’s a +342% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the top ten on january 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# comparison to s&p 500

i’m also tracking the s&p 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/n75xt4x9e6kf1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=780dd4423ecb606c0f528e8e307be11e66ac7c25

the s&p 500 is up +6% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on new year’s day would be worth $1,061 had it been redirected to the s&p.

taking the same invest-$1,000-on-january-1st-of-each-year approach with the s&p 500 that i’ve been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2018 = $2,334 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2019 = $2,489 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2020 = $1,931 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2021 = $1,661 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2022 = $1,309 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2023 = $1,625 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2024 = $1,308 today
* $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2025 = $1,061 today

taken together, the results for a similar approach with the s&p: 

**after eight $1,000 annual investments on january 1st into an s&p 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,717.**

that is up **+71%** [since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+342%** gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios.  

the visual below shows a comparison on roi between a top ten crypto approach and the s&p as per the rules of the top ten experiments:

# conclusion:

to the long time followers of the top ten experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. for those just getting into crypto, i hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

a reporting note: i’ll focus on 2025 top ten portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  july’s extended report is on the 2024 top ten portfolio.  for more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 top ten reports as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mvepyt/1k_into_the_top_10_cryptos_on_january_1st_2025/,104,18,1mvepyt,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9996

2025-08-19 16:09:33+00:00,"bmnr question any idea of exactly how this eth treasury pricing actually works? as far as i can tell, at $50, the cap is at $8.5b with eth holdings worth about $6.5b. 

the plan is to offer more stock to get around $14b more in eth, all relatively soon, so wouldn't the price of bmnr be almost guaranteed to half from the $50 level or even more as it adds in more and more shares as long as eth stays anywhere around the $4k-5k level? 

why would anyone buy at these levels then? is that why we saw massive volume around the $60-70 levels, it was people getting out until bmnr is done diluting its shares and then they'll get back in? seems like if you bought anywhere from $50-70 that you're needing eth to get to $6k+ to start breaking even, especially if you got it around $70, might even need eth at $8-9k by the time it's all said and done with the dilution. 

seems like it would be better to just wait until bmnr is at $25 before buying and then just selling again next time they announce a big share offering, rinse and repeat. 

do i just have a complete misunderstanding of all this? i do see where mstr 10x'd to \~$500 when btc went from $40k to $85k, but since then, that's just been the top for mstr with all the share offerings, despite btc gaining another 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mumty6/bmnr_question/,0,1,1mumty6,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.8664

2025-08-19 00:39:45+00:00,"i had bitcoin when it was $200 and i didn’t hold any back in high school my mid-30’s single parent mom got sick with lyme disease and went from being healthy to barely being able to walk or talk within 6 months. we lived in a very high cost city and i had to figure out how to come up with about $3000/month as a 16 year old very quickly.

not being able to make the money with a minimum wage teen job as well as stay in school, i resorted to selling fake ids. i found a chinese website on the dark web that allowed you to input everything you wanted on each id, choose the state, and ship the id directly to your customer (most being 18-20 year old college kids).

the website only took payment in bitcoin, which at the time wasn’t a household name. it was the first time i had heard of bitcoin so i assumed it was just some kind of currency they used in china. i would physically walk to a bitcoin atm at a deli 30 minutes away and turn cash into bitcoin and then proceed with the payments and orders.

i did this for the last two years of high school, was able to graduate and go to college, and pay for my mom’s medical bills (including chemo). she is now almost 50 and healthy.

unfortunately, after high school i stopped with the hustle and never kept any of the bitcoin. only years later did i start to hear about it

2025-08-18 18:49:01+00:00,"time to bring back app dds to the sub - my overview of turtle **preamble**: 

as a long time user of this subreddit, i've seen it go through many ups and downs as far as quality content. over the last few months, it seems to be mostly articles & memes getting posted, which isn't a bad thing, but we are definitely missing out some research and information on all the exciting things being built in web3.  i'm going to start writing about applications and protocols i have experimented with in hopes to elevate the level of discourse on the sub.

while i will seek to provide accurate information, none of the postings are financial investment advice. users should do their own research and always practice good security measures when trying out a new protocol. 



**dd write-up:** 

over the last few years, a lot of really interesting defi products have hit the market. we've seen automated liquidity managers (alms), restaking protocols, intent-based solvers for swaps, composable onchain lending, etc. one of these fields that really excites me liquidity coordination platforms, and turtle is one of these platforms i've very much enjoyed using.

for those who don't know, i work for polygon. i've always been active in defi and i was thrilled to see katana (a defi-focused chain incubated by polygon) partner with turtle to help bolster initial liquidity on the chain. i think it’s worth explaining why i find it powerful from a liquidity mining perspective.

so what is turtle?

tl;dr - turtle is a defi liquidity coordination platform that connects projects with a base of defi yield-focused users by running structured campaigns to deliver higher yields & boosted points to liquidity providers (lps) while helping protocols & chains acquire long-term liquidity (vs mercenary liquidity).

turtle runs structured campaigns with partner projects that want to attract defi-native liquidity.  the campaigns often offer high yields or points boosts for pre-tge projects.  as an example, on katana's lbtc pool, you're able to earn kat rewards + 4x lombard lux points + 3x veda points + points/turtle boost (5-10%).  for anyone farming points seriously, these boosts are very attractive.

essentially, turtle has become known as a hub for defi users to get the most of their yield. projects want these users, so they partner with turtle and give turtle users boosted yields. projects pay to access that base, and turtle passes part of that value back to users through boosts. the roi for projects can be better than running their own wide-open liquidity mining because the incentives are targeted, coordinated, and more likely to reach sticky users.  

as an example, for katana, while users can withdraw their liquidity at any time, to receive full rewards they need to leave their liquidity in the vaults for 60-90 days, depending on the campaign.  however, this long term incentive helps the chain bootstrap their liquidity instead of spending a tremendous of time sourcing it from vcs and other bd efforts.

vaults are curated and managed by some of the most respected teams in the space like gauntlet, stakehouse, yearn, and 7seas. in addition to the vault curators, other partners include teams like tac, katana, morpho, etherfi, lombard, veda, euler, and merkl (i'm probably forgetting some).

as far as ux/ui goes, turtle is super straightforward. you can view both campaigns (for chains) or deals (for protocols) based on what you want to do. you then deposit directly on the turtle frontend and start earning. one of the best features is turtle never takes custody of member assets and there are no smart contracts involved. you simply connect your wallet to turtle and then receive the rewards when the projects payout. this means that even if you unknowingly deposit into a turtle partner protocol, you will still receive boosted incentives. turtle tracks participation through api integrations with partner protocols.

**disclosures / disclaimers:** 

none of this is risk-free. you’re still taking defi risk when you deposit into any vault or campaign. i’m not qualified to audit smart contracts, and even a well-run program can fail. personally, i’ve been impressed with how turtle approaches risk management and partnerships, but you should still size positions accordingly.

- **i've been diving deep into crypto spam resistance lately, especially after some frustrating ai chats that kept hyping bitcoin's ""unbeatable"" pow while downplaying nano's massive upgrades.**

- **with bitcoin still dealing with ordinals/runes spam and nano rolling out killer anti-spam features in v28.1, i thought it'd be helpful to lay out a full, evidence-based comparison.**

- **this isn't shilling  nano has its adoption hurdles, and bitcoin is king for a reason,but on pure spam defense? nano wins hands down in 2025.**

- **spam attacks here mean flooding networks with junk transactions to congest, bloat, or disrupt (e.g., ddos-style floods, dust attacks, or content embedding like nfts).**

- **i'll break it down by mechanics, recent issues, and why nano's feeless model isn't the weakness it's painted as.**

- **quick background:**

  - **bitcoin: proof-of-work (pow) blockchain with fees. miners prioritize high-fee tx; low-fee spam gets delayed/dropped. but segwit discounts (75% off witness data) enable cheap data spam.**

  - **nano: feeless block-lattice with open representative voting (orv). each tx requires sender pow; upgrades add prioritization and limits to thwart floods.**

- **key spam types and how each handles them:**

  - **transaction floods (pure spam):**

    - **bitcoin: fees deter during high demand (e.g., $10+ per tx in peaks), but cheap in lulls (1-5 sat/vbyte = <$0.01). mempool can bloat, delaying legit tx.**

    - **nano: dynamic pow (dpow) scales computational cost per tx. post-2021 upgrades (v22-v25) added prioritization buckets—spam gets deprioritized based on balance/activity. no monetary cost, but hardware-bound.**

  - **content/data spam (e.g., inscriptions, nfts):**

    - **bitcoin: big issue in 2025. ordinals/runes embed arbitrary data, bloating utxo set and nodes. exploits like ""gamified spam"" persist, with no core fixes—miners profit from fees.**

    - **nano: no equivalent; block-lattice doesn't allow easy data embedding. feeless but pow + filters prevent abuse.**

  - **dust attacks (tiny tx for tracking/bloat):**

    - **bitcoin: common; dust thresholds exist, but bypassed with minimal fees. utxo bloat strains wallets/nodes.**

    - **nano: account-chains make dust irrelevant; low-balance tx are low-priority and auto-dropped if spammy.**

  - **ddos/resource exhaustion:**

    - **bitcoin: nodes handle via mempool limits, but high-volume spam (e.g., 2015/2017 attacks) still spikes fees/node load.**

    - **nano: v28.1's bounded block backlog (bbb) caps unconfirmed tx at 100,000, preventing exhaustion. traffic shaping evens bandwidth, vote filters dedupe junk.**

- **2025 updates and recent issues:**

i wanted some opinions/suggestions/assistance with a current crypto situation.

a guy i'm dating suggested this new coin. so i pumped almost $1500 into a ca and want to cash out or at least ""send"" it to myself on cashapp and cash it out to my bank account. 

the guy i'm seeing said i need to put another $500 into the ca in order for it to be able to swap or cash it out. but, based on what my base app is telling me, i just need some assets that are on the bnb network (same network as this new coin), and i can then swap it out to a ca of my choice, which would be the bitcoin wallet connected to my cashapp. 

the guy i'm dating originally told me after the first or second infusion of cash to the ca he sent me, that i would be able to withdraw. then it was ""okay, one more time and you should be able to cash out,"" but now he's saying it needs one more infusion of cash in order to make it be eligible to cash out!!!

and he's also saying that the ca is closing tomorrow and all the $ in my wallet will be worth nothing. it's of note that last weekend he also told me the ca was closing, but he said it was set to close ""on monday,"" as in this past monday, 4 days ago!!!

screenshot is  attached for reference. any information and/or resources you can point me to would be greatly appreciated!!! and, i specifically want to know the following:

1. is he just asking me to put more $ in so he can just take my $ for himself in his own ca/wallet and scamming me?
2. is this the normal for crypto? you have to put money in a ca then that ca account pushed money back to you? 
3. when a ca closes, does that truly render the funds in my wallet useless?
4. if it's not useless, can i do the following to get the $ to my bank account? 
    * buy another coin that's also on the bnb network to have it as an asset -> go to my wallet and ""send"" the funds to the ca -> connected to my cashapp crypto wallet -> cash out my cashapp crypto  wallet to my bank account connected to my cashapp

2025-08-15 01:20:29+00:00,"why do people think their blockchains are fully on chain? **look into the blockchain you invest in.**  
do not just take the marketing material or a social media post at face value. take the time to understand how it works, where it runs, and who controls it. many people assume that because something is called a blockchain it is automatically fully on chain, but that is rarely the case. aside from value focused blockchains like bitcoin, and execution focused blockchains such as ethereum, the only major platform that runs everything including compute, storage, governance, and execution fully on chain is the internet computer protocol. most others are hybrids at best or partially centralized ledgers presented as blockchains.

when we talk about a blockchain being on chain we are talking about more than just recording transactions in a public ledger. it means the application logic, state changes, and data storage actually live on the blockchain itself where they are verifiable, tamperproof, and run without reliance on third party servers. in a true on chain model, everything from the code to the data is hosted and executed by the decentralized network. remove a node or even multiple nodes and the system continues running because no part of it depends on a single party’s infrastructure.

most blockchains do not operate this way. they run a consensus layer on chain to record transactions, but push the heavy lifting off chain. smart contracts often store pointers to data rather than the data itself. applications usually run their frontends and backends on centralized services like aws, google cloud, or other traditional hosting. even in networks with many validators, the core application stack can still be dependent on centralized infrastructure for hosting, computation, or indexing. if that off chain infrastructure goes down, the application breaks even if the ledger is still technically online.

this hybrid setup creates several problems. it weakens the tamperproof claim because if your backend logic or user interface is controlled by a single company it can be altered or shut down without consensus from the network. it increases the attack surface because hacks and exploits often occur when the off chain backend or bridge is compromised. these incidents are not blockchain ledger breaches but failures caused by centralized components that sit outside the chain.

we see this pattern repeatedly. the headlines about millions of dollars stolen from a protocol often trace back to a compromised front end, a faulty library, or an insecure key. the blockchain ledger itself remains untouched, but because the application logic lives off chain, an attacker can reroute funds or trick users into approving malicious transactions. these incidents happen because the system was never truly self contained on chain to begin with.

icp was built to avoid this problem entirely. its architecture allows developers to deploy canisters, which are smart contracts that can contain both code and data, directly to the blockchain. the frontend, backend, and database can all be hosted on chain and served directly from the network to the user’s browser without intermediaries. this removes the need for aws buckets, centralized backends, or hidden infrastructure dependencies. the code running your application is exactly what you can verify on the blockchain.

ethereum offers an open execution environment where smart contracts live on chain and run without central servers. however, because ethereum is expensive and slower for high volume storage and complex computation, many applications built on ethereum rely on off chain infrastructure for parts of their stack. this is a practical trade off, but it blurs the line between being on chain and being merely anchored to a blockchain.

value based blockchains like bitcoin operate differently. they focus entirely on securing the transfer of value and maintaining a censorship resistant ledger. they do not claim to run applications or host data on chain, so they avoid the mismatch between expectation and reality. their simplicity contributes to their security.

for other blockchains, the marketing often paints a picture of a fully decentralized self contained system when that is not the truth. the moment you realize that the application you use depends on a centralized backend you should also realize that the guarantees of decentralization and tamperproof operation no longer fully apply. this is why so many exploits are possible. attackers target the weak links, and in most so called blockchains, those weak links are off chain.

if you are investing in a project, understand the difference between a ledger on chain and a full application on chain. ledger only platforms can be fine for certain use cases, but they will never provide the same guarantees as a network where the entire stack, from smart contract logic to user facing code, is decentralized. icp proves that it is possible. the question is whether the others even want to try, because moving to a fully on chain architecture would require fundamentally rethinking their business models and governance structures.

until then, the next time someone claims their favorite blockchain is fully on chain, ask them where the application logic runs, where the data lives, and what happens if their chosen cloud provider shuts down for a week. if they cannot answer without naming a centralized service, you will know exactly how on chain it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mqji9q/why_do_people_think_their_blockchains_are_fully/,22,95,1mqji9q,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.0971

the best advice i can give: **zoom out**. look at the big picture. over any 2–3 year period in crypto history, if you held strong and didn’t try to trade every wave, you were likely rewarded. crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. it’s a long game.

so if you believe in the fundamentals of what you're investing in, **stay the course**. don’t let short-term noise wreck long-term gains.

2025-08-21 19:51:06+00:00,"central banks trapped by government debt - here's why crypto might be the winner financial times just dropped a report that central banks are getting squeezed to keep interest rates artificially low because governments borrowed way too much money. this could be huge for crypto trading.

what's happening:

governments around the world went on a borrowing spree and now they need cheap money to service all that debt. central banks are basically stuck - raise rates and governments can't pay their bills, keep them low and inflation stays hot.

this puts us in what economists call ""fiscal dominance""  where debt levels control monetary policy instead of economic fundamentals.

why this matters for crypto:

money has to go somewhere

when bonds pay nothing and savings accounts are a joke, people look for better returns. crypto becomes way more attractive when the ""safe"" alternatives barely keep up with inflation.

we're already seeing this play out. every time the fed hints at keeping rates low, crypto markets pump because traders know more liquidity is coming.

dollar gets weaker

low rates typically weaken the dollar over time. when the dollar loses value, bitcoin and eth look better as alternatives. not just for trading but as actual stores of value.

extended bull market potential

if central banks really are trapped into keeping rates low for years, crypto could see an extended rally. cheap borrowing costs mean more leverage, more institutional buying, and more retail fomo.

the volatility factor

here's the catch - crypto becomes even more sensitive to any hint of rate changes. if markets believe the fed will stay dovish, we moon. but if they even whisper about tightening, leveraged positions get liquidated fast.

what to watch:

fed meetings become even more important for crypto prices

any talk of ""yield curve control"" or ""financial stability"" means they're prioritizing debt costs over inflation

government debt-to-gdp ratios - the higher they go, the more trapped central banks become

my take:

this creates a perfect storm for crypto. traditional finance is getting squeezed from all sides while bitcoin and ethereum offer an escape route from the whole system.

sure, volatility will be insane. but when central banks admit they can't raise rates without breaking something, that's basically advertising bitcoin as digital gold. just remember if you're making moves based on this macro setup, keep track of everything for tax purposes. platforms like awaken.tax make it easier to stay compliant while you capitalize on these opportunities.

the fed might not admit they're trapped, but the market knows. and crypto traders are positioning accordingly.

2025-08-21 10:38:17+00:00,"btc whale dumped their bitcoin bags for ethereum positions..$76m sold, 68k eth bought. why? just saw some wild whale activity that has me thinking about what's really driving these moves from btc to eth.

the latest whale move:

a bitcoin og who held for 7 years just sold 670 btc ($76 million) to go long on ethereum. this whale had been sitting on approx 14k btc worth over $1.6 billion since buying from binance and htx way back in the day.
instead of just holding cash, they immediately opened 4 long positions totaling approx 68k eth - most of it on 10x leverage around the $4,300 mark.
this isn't isolated:

bitmine immersion just added another approx 52k eth to their treasury, bringing total holdings to 1.52 million tokens worth $6.6 billion
institutional wallets were buying up approx 9k eth each ($38 million) during recent dips
other satoshi-era whales have been moving massive amounts of btc after years of dormancy

why the shift is happening:
timing matters: this happened right after btc hit its new ath of $124k and eth almost reclaimed its 2021 high of $4,878. smart money often rotates between assets at these levels.

leverage opportunities: you can't really leverage btc the same way institutional players can leverage eth. these whales are opening massive leveraged positions because they see more upside potential in eth.

institutional infrastructure: ethereum has better institutional tools now. defi protocols, staking yields, and corporate treasury strategies all favor eth over btc for active management.

market maturity: crypto analysts say og bitcoiners selling is actually healthy - it shows new buyers entering and markets maturing. the money isn't leaving crypto, it's rotating.

risk vs reward calculation: when you've made 1000x+ gains on btc, taking some profits to bet on eth's next move up makes sense. especially when eth has more room to grow percentage-wise.

the reality check:
not all these moves worked out immediately. the whale's eth positions went underwater after opening, dropping to $4,080 and putting three positions close to liquidation around $3,700.

but that's the point - whales are willing to take these risks because they see eth as having more upside potential than btc at current levels.

what this means:

we're seeing a rotation from ""store of value"" btc plays into ""growth asset"" eth plays. whales who made their fortunes in btc are now betting that eth will be the next big mover.
this isn't about btc being bad - it's about opportunity cost. when you're sitting on billions in gains, diversifying into the asset with better risk/reward makes sense.
anyone else noticing this pattern of btc profits rotating into eth? feels like we're in the middle of a major capital rotation.

2025-08-20 18:12:53+00:00,"futures has broken my soul i really don’t know where to post this, i feel right sick to my stomach and don’t even know what to do. 

for some background information i have been in crypto since november 2024, mostly investing in bitcoin, solana, and some cto meme coins and have been fairly successful so far all considered i hopped in mid bull run.

i have been trading perps since about april on only major pairs such as btc, eth, sol, tao. i invested 500usd to trade perps as this seemed way less risky than meme coin trenching. 

couple months go by i run the account up 50%, then i proceed to lose it all, i only ever used 10-20x leverage on obvious plays like range highs-lows with loose sl. this was about may.

once i blew my account i decided to take a step back and re evaluate my strategy and watch the markets from the sidelines. fast forward to august, i decide im ready to take my new mentality back into the markets. this time i challenge myself to turn 100usd back into that 500 or so that i lost initially. 

within 2 weeks i ran that $100 account back into the $700 range, i was over the moon. i wanted to prove to myself that i wasn’t a complete degen and that i could be a competent trader and i had done it.

up until 2 days ago, everything was going great, i finally had enough capital to walk away from a trade with a 5-10% pnl and be happy, but this wasn’t good enough. i over-leveraged myself on a bad position and went under water almost immediately, what goes up must come down. all day at work i was watching my position, waiting for it to come down just enough to close without ruining my account… that never happened.

went to bed that night with a super tight tp right about my entry, the market swung within .5% from my entry but did not close position, the market then completely reversed and my entire position was liquidated. 

750usd gone, i am a young fella from canada and work a minimum wage job, yeah it hurts. don’t mess with leverage. i dont even know what to do with myself right now, im at a loss for words and feel like a complete and utter failure i really needed that money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mvmlnq/futures_has_broken_my_soul/,39,64,1mvmlnq,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.0432

i was recently blessed with a $10k bonus and i’d like to invest it in bitcoin. i’ve been into crypto for years, but at some point i stopped following the news and just kept holding my bag—no sales, no new purchases.

based on my analysis of bitcoin’s halving cycles, the best approach might be to invest $1–2k every month over the next 5–10 months. putting it all in right now could be risky if we see a strong 20–30% correction, while stretching it out too long, for example, $500 per month for 20 months, would mean i’d still be buying at the start of the next bear market.

2025-08-19 11:28:37+00:00,"altcoin season signals strengthening hey everyone,

markets have been really interesting this week. bitcoin’s still doing its up and down dance, but if you zoom out, the bull cycle structure is still intact. what caught my attention though is **ethereum dominance creeping higher** that’s usually a strong early sign that an altcoin season might actually be on the horizon.

what really surprised me was the regulatory news. the **fed and sec have basically ended their “special” crypto supervision programs.** that means crypto activity will now just fall under the *same supervision banks already deal with*. to me, that feels like a huge step regulators are finally treating crypto as “normal finance,” not some weird speculative corner of the market.

on the altcoin side, i’ve been digging into the **rwa (real world asset) sector.** a lot of projects there are still just hype with no real use case, but a few are actually trying to tie crypto utility to tangible assets. one that stood out to me is **$rem**, which is building around real estate (probably the most conservative asset class out there). instead of just “tokenizing hype,” they’re trying to link utility to something institutions already trust.

for me, the big signals right now are:

* eth dominance rising → alt season vibes.
* btc still in a bull structure, but we need to stay cautious near the highs.
* rwas could actually become the “serious” narrative this run, especially if utility-backed tokens like $rem get traction.

curious what you all think:  
👉 do you see rwas becoming a legit sector in this bull market?  
👉 or will the money still flow into the usual memes and high risk defi plays once alt season kicks in?

2025-08-18 19:08:18+00:00,"what drives crypto price? cryptos price is community driven

some communities have formed around utilities (the belief that this coin will somehow be useful in the future) but that success isn’t a 1:1 price driver, and most vc utility coins are riddled with insiders and the launch is everything but fair distributed

well now then what is bitcoin? bitcoin has no utility it has an idea behind it. so what it is? it’s a pure belief asset (pba) in which a community of people fell in love with its inspiring narrative (which the og bag workers of bitcoin built out) the goal: to disrupt traditional finance, first appearing post 2008 financial crisis as a peer to peer transactional intermediary meant to cut out wall street

the only reason it holds value is due to fact that people believe it does and this all steams from the underlying community. without og delusional bag workers its doesn’t exist today. you can pretend that it was simply the tech behind it and that it was inevitable but without the og delusion bulls who built out that narrative that you think you now understand it’s doesn’t exist

so when bidding coins you want to look for organic fairly distributed projects that’s are community based. if you must bid utilities coins look for those that have good enough tech and narrative for a legitimate community to form ($eth)

if youve read this far i beg you to check out #spx6900 like just look into it

this is the next iteration of a pure belief asset with a similar narrative of rebellion to bitcoin

in a time when more and more average americans are getting priced out of their local restaurants people are going to look towards alternative investments/ revolution 

many people are slowly subscribing to the idea that the system is broken so let’s tear it down, seen with the growing popularity of socialist u.s representatives across the country

the answer isn’t pro socialist policy it’s getting involved into the pure side of capitalism: activism

first up is their treasury. they’ve already announced holdings of 5.5 bitcoin and now a policy to add ethereum. the next step is for them to actually show that they’re getting more mined bitcoin from their partnership. they also plan to start tokenizing real-world assets and are looking to generate some yield from defi.  if they keep releasing clean dashboards on their progress and those key performance indicators keep trending up, it could be a major catalyst. with a really tight float, any good news could move the needle a lot. the best part is that their leadership is incentivized to hit these goals, which is a big plus in my book. 

the whole approach feels more grounded in execution than just pure hype. instead of hearing big promises, we're seeing them outline specific, measurable steps. it really puts the power back in the hands of us, the investors, to follow along and see if they can deliver. it makes me wonder what other kinds of partnerships or tech they could be working on behind the scenes that haven’t been announced yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mtq2u4/a_new_playbook_for_a_microcap_with_a_big_goal/,8,1,1mtq2u4,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9856

some pointers from me:

bitcoin only has limited coins. unlike dollars, bitcoin’s supply is fixed, so it could gain value over time.

prices move a lot in crypto. most people who try to time the market end up buying high and selling low. holding avoids a lot of those mistakes.

the fomo also kicks in when you sell and the value start climbing up, a psychological panic creeps in and people end up buying on a high. 

nonetheless, imo we don't have to pick any strategy as a hard and fast rule. in many cases, just taking the profit and moving on makes perfect sense and that can many real life cases. 
it's really all about how much risk you're okay with, when you need the money considering how much you have invested. what do you think, what is your preference?

instead, it went from 75,000 usd back up to 85,000 usd, then to 95,000 usd, then it broke 100,000 usd again and i thought: “okay, no panic, it will go back down, the market is overbought.” and then it went from 100,000 usd to 110,000 usd and now even over 120,000 usd. and i could cry, because i will probably never again hold as much btc as i did before.

now i’m really mad at myself, because if i had just held, i’d be massively in profit right now.

for context:  
 → it peaked close to $4,000+ during the 2017 bull.  
 → it's still supported on most major platforms.  
 → it *works* as peer-to-peer digital cash.
