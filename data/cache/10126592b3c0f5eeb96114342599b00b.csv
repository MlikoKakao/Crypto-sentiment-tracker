maybe 5, 10, or 20 years into the future, at a reasonable rate of return.


this allows you to ""coast"" at work, knowing you only need to pay the bills to survive until your investments reach your fire number.


let's say your fire number is $2 million and you want to retire in 5 years. assuming a 30% rate of return on btc, owning 4.56 btc today would get you to $2 million in 5 years.

the best i could come up with would be that you’d want to try to gain citizenship to a country with a favorable tax option (monaco?) and give up whatever citizenship you held.  once having done that would it be as simple as bringing your cold wallet back online to the exchange of your choice and start selling or is there a lot more nuance to that?

do you see any flaws in my system?

i currently have my seed engraved on a metal plate, which is hidden away. my private keys are stored on a satochip-type hardware wallet (smartcard).

when i make a transaction, i launch a dedicated virtual machine on my pc, which only has an up-to-date paid antivirus program and an electrum wallet installed. my physical smartcard allows me to open the electrum wallet and sign transactions.

should i split my btc across several wallets? do you see any improvement point ?  
i'm not planning to sell at all. is there anything i do to improve my system?

given this trajectory, the idea of bitcoin reaching $1 million no longer feels like a wild fantasy, it’s increasingly viewed as a long-term possibility by some investors and analysts. however, the more provocative question is: could it go even higher? could we one day see btc at $5 million, or even $10 million?

of course, such valuations would imply an astronomical market capitalization, well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. achieving that would require not only widespread global adoption, but a significant reconfiguration of the global financial system, with bitcoin possibly absorbing functions of store of value, reserve asset, and even partial medium of exchange on a global scale.

while such outcomes may seem far-fetched today, it’s worth noting that bitcoin has surprised us repeatedly in the past. from being dismissed as an experiment, to surpassing gold in performance, to being held by institutional investors and nation-states, btc’s history is defined by breaking boundaries that once seemed immovable. the question, then, may not be whether it can reach these prices—but under what conditions such a shift could happen.

basically you build up your bitcoin holdings to reach about $1,000,000 then borrow about $110k or about 10% of your bitcoin value in your first year of retirement to fund your living expenses of $100k for that year and pay off say, $10k in interest . in the second year, you borrow an additional  $125k to pay the interest on $235k and have $100k to live on in the second year. then just repeat this every year onwards. so your total loan amount increases every year but that's ok since the value of your bitcoin goes up faster than the loan amount as a % of your bitcoin holdings. any loaned amounts are tax free since it's debt and you're not selling any bitcoin. as your bitcoin value grows higher you can borrow more to have more than $100k for annual living expenses. this seems to make sense to me. anyone see flaws in his reasoning?

if safe and reliable bitcoin lenders with good interest rates are hard to find, then an alternative could be to buy bitcoin etf units instead of bitcoin. my margin trading account lets me borrow cash against my etf holdings. and the interest rate is the prime rate in canada which is now 4.95% which is probably much lower than most bitcoin lenders' rates. and no one has my bitcoin keys. just have to maintain your margin capacity in the case of a bitcoin price decline. but if the loan amount is no more than about 10% of the value of your bitcoin etf holdings, you should be fine.

these approaches seem better than borrowing with a home equity line of credit or mortgage since with a home equity loan or mortgage, you're limited to a maximum loan amount which doesn't increase as the value of your bitcoin holdings increases (it's a lot more hassle to refinance a mortgage if the value of your home goes up).

2025-08-01 06:09:26,"charles schwab likely to offer direct bitcoin trading/custody soon here, i examine direct spot bitcoin trading services at the top three major brokerage houses: **fidelity**, **vanguard**, and **charles schwab**, and how this landscape is likely to change soon, significantly improving direct, non-derivative access to bitcoin, as well as the knock-on implications of this.

firstly, we all know that **fidelity**, through its subsidiary fidelity digital assets, has been the brokerage leading the industry in offering crypto products/services to its over 51 million active accounts (as at 2024) and over $15 trillion in aum (as at 2025), including one of the first bitcoin spot etfs, fidelity wise origin bitcoin fund (fbtc). specifically, fidelity crypto was open to users as of april 2023, which allows fidelity account holders to invest directly in bitcoin, the first major brokerage house to do so. 

secondly, i think we're all aware of **vanguard**, who as of 2021 stated that ""the long-term investment case is weak"" for cryptocurrencies ([source](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think)). as such, outside of mandatory exposure through stock indices, it is unlikely that vanguard will offer any crypto-oriented products/services to its 50 million active account holders.

lastly, and most importantly, **charles schwab** with its 37 million active accounts and over $10 trillion in aum (as at 2025) is apparently preparing to follow in fidelity's footsteps. in january 2025, schwab updated its dedicated webpage on cryptocurrencies, which included an interesting note in the faqs:

[https:\/\/www.schwab.com\/cryptocurrency \(as of january 20, 2025, wayback machine\)](https://preview.redd.it/67baayfujcgf1.png?width=2484&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c78f7a399bb53db121e48c719129f86534a6eb)

it states that schwab is planning to offer spot crypto trading once regulatory uncertainty abates. with the passage of the genius act in july, and the clarity and anti-cbdc surveillance state acts working through congress, it is likely that the regulatory clarity schwab is waiting for has arrived, combined with the market shaping and de-risking by fidelity paving the way. therefore, **i think it's very likely that we see schwab launch its own dedicated spot bitcoin/crypto trading within its larger traditional brokerage platform by 2026**.

this is significant for a number of reasons: 1.) not only does this **create a massive on-ramp for retail investors to get direct, non-derivative exposure to bitcoin** at a time when retail fervor has yet to pick up in this bull market, it also, in my opinion, 2.) extends integration with traditional financial products such that **bitcoin holdings can directly collateralize consumer credit** (loans, mortgages, etc.), further legitimizing bitcoin as a true financial mainstay, breaking the narrative of it as a highly volatile and speculative asset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1meosxa/charles_schwab_likely_to_offer_direct_bitcoin/,Bitcoin,60,6,1meosxa,reddit,0.9881,115567.06812831752

ln seems to still have limitations in order to support global trade, based on my understanding. 

in order to open a channel you and the other party fund the channel with btc, this is the initial transaction that happens on chain. then once the channel closes another happens. of course if billions were doing this bitcoin network would fail. 

to combat this i’ve learned that you ideally wouldn’t close channels, if you’re going to transact with that individual or company again why close it? so that helps with tps onchain, but not enough. 

i’ve also learned that once you open one channel you get access to transactions with anyone else that also has a channel open to that individual. so this helps minimize the need to open channels.

this would in theory create a large web of connected channels that as it grew larger the less need their would be to open new channels.

still, with billions of people and great ui/ ux i still have a hard time believing bitcoin could handle global trade on this model. 

originally i thought “why can’t you just batch channel openings but i learned that in order to open a channel you must fund it which requires a transaction. 

if the transition happens very slowly and more and more channels open but never close i could envision a future where there’s already billions of open channels ready for anyone to just buy the already open channel and begin using it. but my napkin math says it would take ~60 years for 10billion channels to open without breaking the network. maybe with some more future innovations we could see that number fall but that’s not exactly truth seeking..

2025-08-01 22:08:50,"advice - new to btc new to btc here - thinking of doing a lump sum 25k purchase and then continuing to pile

i have looked into strike

here is what i have so far gathered from gpt:  
🔹 step 1: set up your strike account

1. **download the strike app** (ios or android).
2. sign up and complete **identity verification (kyc)**.
3. link your **bank account** or debit card.
4. deposit funds — you can start with a **$25,000 usd lump sum** or smaller test amounts first.

# 🔹 step 2: buy bitcoin on strike

1. in the strike app, tap **“bitcoin”** or **“buy”**.
2. enter the amount (e.g. $25,000).
3. confirm the purchase — you now own btc inside strike.

⚠️ **important**: this btc is held *custodially* by strike. you don't truly own it until it’s in your own wallet.

# 🔹 step 3: set up a cold wallet

if you haven’t already, choose a **cold wallet (hardware wallet)**. common options:

* **trezor** (one or model t)
* **ledger** (nano s plus or nano x)
* **coldcard** (advanced)
* **foundation passport** (privacy-focused)

set it up:

1. initialize the device (generate a **seed phrase**, write it down and store securely).
2. create a **receive address** (starts with `bc1...` or `1...`).

you’ll need this address to transfer btc *out of strike*.

# 🔹 step 4: transfer btc from strike to your cold wallet

1. on strike, go to **“bitcoin” > “send”**.
2. paste your **wallet’s btc receive address** (from your cold wallet).
3. **double check** the address is correct.
4. choose the amount to send (all or portion).
5. confirm the transaction.

strike will broadcast it to the network and you’ll receive it into your cold wallet.

# 🔹 step 5: verify receipt in your cold wallet

* open your wallet interface (e.g. trezor suite or ledger live).
* confirm the btc has arrived.
* optionally, verify on-chain using a **block explorer** like [mempool.space]().

# 🧠 tips for long-term success

* **start small** with a test transaction before doing the full $25k.
* **label** your cold wallet receive addresses (e.g. “strike transfer 1”).
* store your **seed phrase offline** — *never upload it to a computer or cloud*.
* consider a **passphrase** for additional protection.
* **enable 2fa** on strike and anywhere you interact with crypto.

i know the top btc wallet belongs to satoshi and has never moved. but the next biggest holders like microstrategy (via saylor), blackrock, coinbase, and etf custodians hold massive amounts. from what i understand, saylor keeps raising money by issuing stock and using the proceeds to buy more btc.

what happens if something goes sideways? say, shareholders sue, microstrategy collapses, or saylor is forced to sell his btc to cover liabilities? a huge dump from just one or two of these whales could nuke the price. and it’s not just saylor, other etfs and big institutions hold large chunks too. if multiple major holders had to liquidate at once, wouldn’t that crush the market?

and people can argue that this is fair or unfair to me this is not question about fairness, it just is how it is. 

at the same time you can bet that powerful countries like china and usa will not accept their place at 1% they have now while having 25% of global gdp. 

you can bet they will either force other parties to give them their btc or they will simply refuse to play the game. 

the problem with btc is that if you accept it those that own it tell the rules, if there was a party with 30% of btc and btc will over time go into one place they can essentially group up with few other parties and even if they not going for 51% attack they will still decide what amount of value will things have as they speak of all monetary value that exists. 

what will happen let's say imagine new country growing just as china did, becoming a strong competitor, they will become too regulated by control of let's say usa has on bitcoin because surely usa or any big party knows that possession is power. 

and so what will new growing power do? simply refuse to play the game and make their own currency, but why would you do something similar to btc when you can have more control over it, like usa has with fiat? 

such dissent to using btc will make it insanely unstable and carry some very dangerous consequences making countries not want to depend on it or simply want more control over money.

2025-08-02 13:10:39,"is there a better way to gain long-term bitcoin exposure than just buying and holding? a lot of people just hold bitcoin and hope for the best. that seems to work when the price is going up, but i’ve been wondering if there’s a more efficient way to get long-term exposure.

holding btc doesn’t produce any cash flow. you don’t earn anything while waiting. and when you finally sell, you deal with taxes. self-custody also adds its own stress unless you’re deeply technical.

recently i came across a different approach. some public companies hold bitcoin in their treasury and try to increase how much btc backs each share over time. they do this by raising capital and buying more btc, without issuing new stock. so your single share ends up giving you access to more bitcoin than before.

if bitcoin goes up as well, the effect compounds. microstrategy and metaplanet are already doing this. a few crypto-native platforms have started highlighting this model, including bitunix, which seems to be paying closer attention to how these treasury dynamics work in different market conditions.

i actually came across a breakdown of this on bitunix’s platform while researching. surprisingly well structured. not saying it’s the only place, but it’s been useful so far.

i’m still trying to figure out how sustainable this approach really is. it sounds good in theory, but i wonder if it's just another form of hidden leverage that works during bull runs and then falls apart when things go sideways.

curious if anyone here has looked into these kinds of companies. do you think this is a better way to get crypto exposure, or just a trend that will fade?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mfq6nl/is_there_a_better_way_to_gain_longterm_bitcoin/,Bitcoin,0,27,1mfq6nl,reddit,0.993,113608.90920739956

rich people and also smart upper-middle class folks have realized that fiat is not a good store of value hence they keep most of their wealth in assets that actually grow like stocks, real estate, etc. this hoarding of real estate by them is what causes housing crisis. 

  
but the people who are actually affected by inflation are the people who keep their wealth in fiat, whose wealth is slowly degrading. this is causes wealth inequality.

  
bitcoin can solve them both as it gives a way for all of them to store their wealth. people might prefer bitcoin over real estate (as an investment) as its more liquid and easier to transport thus solving the housing crisis (at least partly).

**problem:** i was checking bitcoin price 50+ times a day. each check made me anxious and want to break my dca plan.

**solution:** built a dashboard that blurs the price after 5 checks. by check #20, you literally can't see it anymore.

also shows fear & greed index:

* under 30 = good dca day
* over 70 = wait
* middle = stick to schedule

the blur effect works - makes you conscious of your checking addiction. some days i ""win"" by not checking at all.

i've been thinking a lot about long-term planning and how to diversify for retirement beyond traditional methods. since i already invest a small portion of my portfolio in bitcoin, i decided to run a thought experiment to see how feasible it would be to lean into it more for my retirement goals.

my biggest challenge was visualizing the numbers. how much would i need to contribute and for how long, considering the volatility and potential growth?

while researching, i found a [bitcoin retirement calculator](https://threedolar.com.br/en/bitcoin-retirement-calculator/) that helped me make this more tangible. i used the following inputs for the simulation:

* **monthly contribution:** $1.7k
* **current age:** 30 
* **retirement goal:** $5,000,000

this was the result:

https://preview.redd.it/15ccp172dtgf1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=164d023d949e7fb7263a18f1771a2a98a9840bc6

i have to admit, the result left me feeling both optimistic and skeptical. on one hand, it seems like a possible path if growth projections hold up. on the other hand, we all know the crypto market is a rollercoaster.

i'd love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have been on this journey longer:

* do you think the metrics in this simulation are realistic?
* what factors might a calculator like this miss (e.g., taxes, fees, the impact of halvings)?
* for those also investing for the long term, how do you factor in volatility when making plans for 20 or 30 years down the line?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mgkibl/i_ran_a_bitcoin_retirement_simulation_is_this/,Bitcoin,34,58,1mgkibl,reddit,0.9748,

4) not your keys not you cheese

5) don't post about bitcoin in r/ butcoin

6) do not share your seed phrase with anyone

7) never input your seed phrase anywhere except your cold wallet

8) prepare an inheritance plan for your beloved ones

the situation forced me to trade on the dips and rises of bitcoin after receiving my salary, in order to earn all the missing fees (that was, an additional 20% of my salary each month). every month it was extremy stressful 8 days between reciving salery and paying all charges. 

after 1.5 years of living under stress, i got a better job. my situation improved and i was able to regularly save 10% of my paycheck each month.

at that time i didn't want to speculate and trade more, so i have left a small part of btc worth $2500 - because maybe will grow someday, and selling it then won't give me anything.

a few months ago i sold my entire 0.5 btc receiving $60,000 for it. with this and the savings i made past 5 years i bought an apartment. 

i know that this is not an inspiring story of sudden wealth, but:
- it gave me chance to finish university with bachelor degree
- i have got good job which i like with nice contract 
- in my first year of trading one night i was crying how the tax low in my country is fuc**d up i start chatting with guy who gave me advice how to make bitcoin income legal - now he is my husband!
- i bought with him new flat in the best district of my city - quite big, with 3 small bedrooms (young family friendly!)

i bought into bitcoin a while ago with a long-term retirement mindset. i haven’t followed things closely for a few years, but lately i’ve been hearing more about the potential risks quantum computing could pose to btc. 

given that the creator is unknown and the speculation that they are no longer with us - i’m wondering what the future might look like in terms of bitcoin’s ability to evolve and remain secure.

a few questions to spark discussion:

	1.	is bitcoin actively being developed to stay ahead of threats like quantum computing?

	2.	if quantum computing advances significantly, how vulnerable is bitcoin as it currently stands?

	3.	without a known creator or central authority, who is responsible for ensuring bitcoin adapts to major technological shifts like this? is there a possibility that the creator has passed away, leaving bitcoin compromised to threats?

2025-08-04 10:01:21,"i need your thoughts about why bitcoin could realistically hit $183k (backed by data) let’s break down this cyclical bitcoinpattern:


🔹 1st halving – nov 28, 2012

price at halving: ~$12.35

ath: ~$1,163 (dec 2013, 372 days later)

gain: +9,325%


🔹 2nd halving – jul 9, 2016

price at halving: ~$650.63

ath: ~$19,783 (dec 2017, 526 days later)

gain: +2,940%

drop in roi vs previous cycle: −68.5%


🔹 3rd halving – may 11, 2020

price at halving: ~$8,821

ath: ~$68,979 (nov 2021, 548 days later)

gain: +682%

drop in roi vs previous cycle: −76.8%


so yeah... returns are dropping every cycle — around 73% less each time.

🔸 now, 4th halving – apr 19, 2024

price at halving: ~$64,969

if the pattern continues and we see ~73% less roi again:
→ 682% × (1 − 0.73) ≈ 184% gain


📈 that gives us a projected ath of:
$64,969 × (1 + 1.84) ≈ ~$183,830
around october 2025, if the average time to ath holds (~537 days post-halving).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mh9bl0/i_need_your_thoughts_about_why_bitcoin_could/,Bitcoin,108,77,1mh9bl0,reddit,0.886,114442.5495561121

not a huge brand but quite big and well known which i do the marketing through social media, and i got paid by commission, i charge around 400 usd per work, and usually takes 5-7 days to finish with me working 3-4 hours per day, pretty chill, but the downside i could go for a month without client lol. that's why i save and will put more in bitcoin

i plan to retire at 35 or 40 though. grateful enough to already have house, car, and bike that i love. so i just need to survive and to retire.

examples often include small amounts used on the lightning network, to buy a coffee, a steak, etc...

developers offer numerous applications based on nostr, highlighting the use of btc via the lightning network.

with the changes made by ai moderation on meta's platforms, this was an opportunity for me to test a pro-btc social network (didn't see any alt or shit coin, only btc on lightning network). i chose to start with primal just a few hours ago.

just like on a traditional social network, there are likes and comments; the main difference is that you can also donate satoshis if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, a project, etc...

so, here's a concrete example of a simple use case, accessible to everyone, and which, if nostr continues to gain popularity, will encourage the adoption of bitcoin and the lightning network.

for those who haven't tried it yet but are on traditional social media (fb, instagram, tiktok, x, etc...), i encourage you to take an interest. 
anything that promotes the simple and transparent use of btc in everyday life should be highlighted.

as with any platform, there will always be good and bad, and be wary of scammers who will find ways to obtain donations. 

but for ordinary creators like me, who are simply looking to share our videos or photos, it's an opportunity to combine our passions and promote the wider adoption of bitcoin.

i don't add my personal link to my primal account, cause i don't know if it's welcome, but you can find it if you want.

2025-08-04 13:48:09,"bitcoin bull case, why now is the time to get excited bitcoin is holding firm around the $114k mark, showing impressive resilience in a market that recently absorbed a $9b spot sale without any significant dip. this is a strong signal that institutional demand and on-chain liquidity are healthier than ever, as the market can now handle multi‑billion‑dollar transactions without breaking stride.

macro conditions are also starting to favor risk assets again. the federal reserve has kept interest rates steady, and overall liquidity is slowly creeping upward—historically, this kind of environment has been a major driver for bitcoin rallies. as risk appetite returns, btc often benefits first, and current market behavior reflects that.

on the technical side, bitcoin is holding a strong support zone between $111k and $114k, lining up perfectly with the 0.618 fibonacci retracement and key volume nodes. at the same time, a classic falling‑wedge pattern is forming on the charts, a structure that often leads to strong upside moves. if btc can break through the $118k–$120k resistance zone, analysts are watching for a potential push toward $125k–$140k in the near term, with the possibility of even higher levels if momentum carries into the next leg of the cycle.

adding to the confidence, long‑term believers and seasoned investors like robert kiyosaki have openly signaled that they are ready to double down on dips. this mix of strong fundamentals, supportive macro conditions, and bullish technicals paints a clear picture: bitcoin’s next leg up might be closer than most think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mhdxur/bitcoin_bull_case_why_now_is_the_time_to_get/,Bitcoin,6,4,1mhdxur,reddit,0.991,

2025-08-04 14:27:13,"french lawmakers are proposing a plan to mine bitcoin using the country's surplus nuclear energy france's nuclear reactors produce constant, carbon-free energy, often creating a costly surplus. the genius of the proposal is that bitcoin miners are the perfect ""flexible load"", they can be turned on to soak up this excess power when demand is low, and turned off instantly when the grid needs the energy elsewhere.

for bitcoin, this is a massive win. it means a huge, stable source of clean energy is being dedicated to the network. this not only bolsters bitcoin's security and decentralization but also directly addresses environmental criticisms by utilizing power that would otherwise go to waste. a ""made in france"" bitcoin, powered by clean energy, strengthens the entire ecosystem.

now i want to actually own btc. my plan is to sell the cfds, withdraw to my bank, buy real btc through an exchange, and then move it to my own wallet.

timing is always a bit of a gamble, since i could end up selling during a local peak and buying back during a dip, or the other way around. i know there's never a perfect moment, but i want to be in control and accept that risk.

a few things i'm still unsure about:

* hardware wallet or would you trust a good software wallet for long-term (10 years+) holding?
* are there important things to keep in mind during this migration, like fees, taxes, timing, or risks that i might not be thinking of? for example, i’m aware that there are conversion costs when selling on etoro and moving funds to euro, their spread is pretty steep compared to most exchanges, and there are also network fees when sending btc to my own wallet. if i’m missing any other “hidden” costs, let me know.
* is there any reason not to go full self-custody, or any alternatives worth considering?

my reasoning to take this bet is based on the fact 
i do hold a decent bag of btc. i would love for it to hit 150k because that would mean my net worth would go up dozens and dozens of thousands of dollars. so, losing my $396 wouldn't mean anything. but, if btc doesn't hit 150k, then at least i win $154 for my troubles (about $1/day for the rest of 2025).

great, but now let’s fast forward to 100 years from now, when btc is the main store of value and again we have inequality in access to wealth…

i can imagine a future ‘rebellion’ would decide to screw btc, as it only helped people who happened to be alive at the time, and come up with a new system that is more equitable either for their generation or solve the problem for future generations too (avoiding creating a new store of value asset class every 100 years or so).

i know i'm late to the party because of market cap fundamentals, i know there won't be a 100x for me. however, i was told i'm not late, because 2x is a good dead that outpaces inflation by a lot (yes, it's actually true), so i should still keep buying.

how accurate is the 2x estimation? if it had the 50x or 100x potential, i would have gone all-in, because i'm in a very demoralizing and dehumanizing financial situation.

to be honest, 2x a year is still a very good deal. if this is actually the case, i will start investing in bitcoin again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1micq1j/is_2x_a_year_possible/,Bitcoin,0,24,1micq1j,reddit,0.5668,

at the same time, the 200 wma is at \~50k but i think i am even more scared that we are going parabolic soon and that i will regret not doing a pretty significant lump sum buy now for the rest of my life. 

been in btc for a little over a year and have dca'd 2k-3k/month so far (with lump sumps i average 4k a month into btc). loan would only cost me about usd 500 a month for the next 12 years. 50k is about what i am able to put away annually so i could pay it off pretty quickly if i really wanted and needed to. i can also slow down my dca to a ""modest"" 1k a month and start putting money into strc or something to save up for lump summing if we go to 50 or 70k again. then i guess it wouldn't hurt so much to be sitting on the 50k loan with a 50% unrealized loss.

i wouldn't have second thoughts about upgrading our second car for the same amount... and a car would depreciate 50% in just as many months... but why this? it makes sense to keep the second car for a few more years and getting 0.46 btc instead, right?

1) btc is 115k today, which is 35k away from 150k.
2) there are only about 87 days from today until oct 31, 2025.
3) in order for btc to get from 115k to 150k, btc would have to rise by +30% in 87 days.
4) btc market cap is +2.6 trillion
5) in order to get to 150k, btc would need to gain +168 billion in market cap in only 87 days.
6) there is pretty much no chance 160billion of liquidity is coming into btc in the next 87 days from retail or anywhere else. if that was possible, btc would be at 4 trillion by nov 1st, 2025. there is no way that is happening.
7) this leads me to believe that no matter how much $ you have, if you bet it all against btc reaching 150k before nov 1st, 2025, you have like a 99% chance at winning.
therefore, im testing my theory by betting $400 to only get back $500 ($100 profit).

2025-08-07 00:23:32,"you're (probably) going to make more money if you invested in btc at $10,000 than if you did at $100 crazy statement, right? well obviously there will be a few diamond handed exceptions to the rule out there - but, for the most part, i truly believe those of us who got into btc when it already sat at a much higher total per coin will eventually make more money than those who got in closer to the ground level.

**at $100**

imagine for one moment that you were one of those lucky few. let's say you went all in at a time when the future of the token, and crypto as a whole, was still very much up in the air. you threw $2k into this completely unknown and unreliable asset.

you have 20 coins to your name and you're ready to see how this pans out. it's growing. oh boy, is it growing. one coin is now worth $1,000! that initial $2,000 you invested is now worth $20k. this is unbelievable. so do you sell and get an amazing payday for your gamble?

let's be realistic. a lot of people (not all, but a lot) would probably cut and run. crypto is still totally volatile and seen by almost everyone as a (dangerous) fad. that $20k could turn right back into $2k (or worse) again overnight. most people cash out. and of the few who don't, fewer still don't cash out when the coin reaches $2,000 and you see that return double to $40k.

it's an amazing number. better than you could possibly ever expect investing in any other kind of asset. but the risk of losing out is now too great to ignore. that $40k is yours and you feel pretty smug.

**at $10,000**

alright, you know what you're getting into. crypto is here and it isn't going anywhere. bitcoin isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, it's a way to offset inflation, fiat currency depreciation, and keep your money tied up in a way that keeps it out of the hands of centralised banking chains. you're in it for the long game.

you invest $2k. okay, it only buys you 0.2 of a coin. but that's 0.2 more btc than most people have.

flash forward to 6 august 2025. one coin is now worth $115k. and that 0.2 btc is now worth $23k.

that's a brilliant return. more than 10x your initial investment. but you know this is just the beginning. bitcoin is here to stay. governments are investing in federal reserves. expert financial managers are now suggesting you diversify your portfolio with it. this is going somewhere special.

you hold. sorry, hodl.

the year is 2035. bitcoin has had a crazy ten years of dips and peaks. but it now sits at $300k. your 0.2 btc is now worth $60k. that's a tremendous return on $2k. but still, you hodl.

the year is 2050. president swift is halfway into her second term in office. england have just won their fourth successive world cup. and in far more realistic circumstances, one coin is now worth $1m. your 0.2 btc is now valued at $200k.

yet still you hodl. you do so because hodling or selling isn't even a factor anymore. btc is here and it's here to stay. it's a global currency which every nation on the planet uses. why would you throw away your money by converting it to any form of fiat that still exists?

you put $2k into the asset and now you have $200k worth. without adding a single dime more.

would you have done been able to hold on so long if you'd seen the crazy returns of a $100-era coiner? i have my doubts. i have my doubts.

1) i own btc.
2) if btc goes to 150k, i will make a killing
3) i don't think btc will hit 150k eoy 2025
4) i pray btc will hit 150k and never go lower
5) i made bets that btc won't hit 150k by eoy
6) i can win both ways if btc goes up but not passed 150k.
7) again, i love btc and banked my entire future and retirement on it.

all this being said, look at the pick above and explain to me how someone that owns, for example, 1btc right now can lose this bet.
a) if it stays under 150k, they win $1,900
b) if btc goes from 115k (current price) to 150k, a whole coiner would gain 35k, but lose the 10k bet = still up 25k.
also, btc could go up to like 130k, 140k, but not over 150k. so, a whole coiner would win both ways.

·       buying a trezor.

·       keeping the 24 word passkey on multiple pieces of paper.

·       putting a small amount of btc, then deleting my trezor software and then successfully re opening my wallet a few times using the 24-word passkey.

·       transferring my btc funds from exchange to cold trezor wallet.

·       locking up some of the pieces of paper containing the 24 words in a rental safehouse (for stuff like expensive jewelry).

2025-08-07 06:06:46,"in these days of price price price, a piece of bitcoin when it was priceless one of the last posts made by **hal finney** on bitcointalk.org. for the uninitiated, **hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin**; 10 coins... from satoshi nakamoto. **here goes:**

""i thought i'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for bitcoin and me.

for those who don't know me, i'm hal finney. i got my start in crypto working on an early version of pgp, working closely with phil zimmermann. when phil decided to start pgp corporation, i was one of the first hires. i would work on pgp until my retirement. at the same time, i got involved with the cypherpunks. i ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of bitcoin. i've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (i was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. i was more idealistic; i have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

when satoshi announced bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. they tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

i was more positive. i had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. plus i was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both wei dai and nick szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with bitcoin. i had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called rpow. so i found bitcoin fascinating.

when satoshi announced the first release of the software, i grabbed it right away. i think i was the first person besides satoshi to run bitcoin. i mined block 70-something, and i was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. i carried on an email conversation with satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

today, satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. but at the time, i thought i was dealing with a young man of japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. i've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so i recognize the signs.

after a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so i left it running. those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a cpu, not even a gpu. i mined several blocks over the next days. but i turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. in retrospect, i wish i had kept it up longer, but on the other hand i was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. it's one of those glass half full half empty things.

the next i heard of bitcoin was late 2010, when i was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. i dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. as the price climbed up to real money, i transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

speaking of heirs, i got a surprise in 2009, when i was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. i was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, i'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. i'd run several half marathons, and i was starting to train for a full marathon. i worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and i thought i was all set. that's when everything went wrong.

my body began to fail. i slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. in august, 2009, i was given the diagnosis of als, also called lou gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

als is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. it causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. it is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. my symptoms were mild at first and i continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

today, i am essentially paralyzed. i am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. i operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. it also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. i spend all day in my power wheelchair. i worked up an interface using an arduino so that i can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

it has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. i can still read, listen to music, and watch tv and movies. i recently discovered that i can even write code. it's very slow, probably 50 times slower than i was before. but i still love programming and it gives me goals. currently i'm working on something mike hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""trusted computing"", to harden bitcoin wallets. it's almost ready to release. i just have to do the documentation.

and of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. i have skin in the game. but i came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. i lived through the crash of 2011. so i've seen it before. easy come, easy go.

that's my story. i'm pretty lucky overall. even with the als, my life is very satisfying. but my life expectancy is limited. those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. my bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. i think they're safe enough. i'm comfortable with my legacy.""

*hal finney died on august 28, 2014.*

i was late to the game in 2023, and even then only bought a small amount. about a month ago found my ledger nano and found a few thousand dollars in there. between then and now have read up again and once the republicans passed the bill that increased the debt ceiling another 5 trillion and cut taxes on the rich i knew usd was fucked (also know all the stats about money printing, never stops).

i recently quit contributing 10% to my 401k, reduced it down to get full company match. i quit contributing to my ira also (this one i’d like advice on). i now have a dca strategy of $92/day which will give me roughly $33k/year in contributions to btc.

i get quarterly bonuses from my job (around $5k net) and i’m wondering what i should do with these lump sums of cash. when i don’t know what to do i at least park it in a high yield savings account. i obviously want my cost average to be as low as possible to just shoving in lump sums at high prices given btcs volatility seems like a novice move. maybe just increase dca amount? 

does anyone still do iras? i would do roth back door since i am phased out of normal roth contribution limits.

don’t want to be an idiot on tax free gains and compounding interest. switching to an hsa as well to get that triple tax benefit as well. i just want to be as smart as possible. i used to think diversification was the best tool, but diversify in fiat just makes me feel like i’m swimming upstream against my own conviction.

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ⚡",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mkg02i/first_sats_from_nostr/,Bitcoin,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,0.9949,

# what happens when 100% of bitcoin is mined?

once the full 21 million btc are mined (estimated around year 2140), no new bitcoins will be issued. miners will be compensated solely through transaction fees. the supply becomes perfectly fixed, and issuance (block subsidy) drops to zero, leaving fees to incentivize security and transaction processing.

# who is satoshi nakamoto?

satoshi nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, who published the whitepaper in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. satoshi collaborated publicly for about two years and then stepped back in 2010–2011. their identity remains unknown.

# why could bitcoin’s price go up?

bitcoin has a fixed supply (21m), predictable issuance, and growing adoption. as demand increases against a capped supply, basic supply-and-demand dynamics can push price higher. network effects, institutional adoption (e.g., etfs), and halvings reducing new supply can amplify this. not financial advice.

# what is a halving?

approximately every 210,000 blocks (\~4 years), the block subsidy (new btc issued per block) halves. this reduces new supply entering the market and historically has been associated with multi-year market cycles.

# what are satoshis (sats)?

satoshis are the smallest unit of bitcoin. 1 btc = 100,000,000 sats. many wallets and services display values in sats for precision and usability.

# how is the network secured after 2140?

after block subsidies end, miners earn transaction fees from users. as usage grows, fee revenue is expected to sustain mining and network security.

# is bitcoin energy wasteful?

bitcoin uses proof-of-work, which consumes energy to secure the network. mining often seeks the lowest-cost energy, incentivizing renewables and acting as a flexible load that can stabilize grids and monetize stranded or curtailed energy.

the company maintains approximately £19.5 million in net cash reserves available for future bitcoin acquisitions. this substantial war chest positions them to continue their aggressive cryptocurrency accumulation strategy – the main factor in the explosion in the firm’s share price since ipo.

while bitcoin captures headlines, the smarter web company’s foundation remains its web services business. the company provides web design, development, and online marketing solutions to clients.

2025-08-08 09:47:38,"word-of-mouth bitcoin social phenomenon i see a lot of posts about people damaging or losing relationships due to bitcoin conversations.  often times it seems people try to ""orange pill"" their friends and often times it doesn't work.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

i got an idea to have some sort of insurance in the case i lose my coins, while still doing self custody. in the spirit of lose your keys, not your coins, i am thinking of building this service where all your utxos in your wallet have a special script that has a spending tree where there is a fallback where my service can trigger a transfer, which activates a dead man switch where the wallet holder can cancel the spending tree during 1 month time to assure some level of trust. 

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

because what else is he to do? reveal who he is? get bombarded by the entire world and hired by the cia, nsa and all the other alphabet agencies to make a technology to supersede his magnum opus? no. this is his gift to humanity. no questions asked. use it or lose it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mkx366/are_long_winded_shitposts_around_the_origins_of/,Bitcoin,0,7,1mkx366,reddit,0.9926,

2025-08-09 04:10:21,"softwar: this book about bitcoin blew me away i recommended this book when i only started it to few crypto friends and now that i finished it (and i’m completely blow away by it’s potential
implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

if this theory will be proven right, it will reshape the world, hopefully for the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlg6xi/softwar_this_book_about_bitcoin_blew_me_away/,Bitcoin,285,84,1mlg6xi,reddit,-0.7031,116397.67926922366

how it works

* **current btc holdings**: enter how much btc you already own (e.g., 0.003 btc).
* **dca amount & frequency**: specify how much you’ll invest (e.g., $500) and how often (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
* **progress indicator**: displays a progress bar showing what percentage of 1 btc you’ve reached.

key features

* enter current btc balance, dca amount, and frequency
* calculates number of contributions needed 
* shows a progress bar toward 1 btc

feedback areas

* ui improvements (layout, colors, clarity)
* must-have metrics or charts (e.g., cumulative spend vs. btc acquired)

i’m wondering what the bitcoin community thinks about this. is the current plan — relying on transaction fees alone — the best long-term approach for security, or do you see potential challenges?

a quadrillion?

that’s crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

i have been investing since the beginning of 2024, the same amount in dollars every week. so far, i have only increased the amount i invest once.

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.

i’ve also been paying attention to warren’s comments about debt to gdp…specifically:   buffett described the current us fiscal deficit as “unsustainable over a very long period of time” and warned that “it has the aspect to it that gets uncontrollable at a certain point.”

that said, with the rise of ai in every aspect of every business, gdp will likely rise significantly.

how are you all thinking though that?  debt to gdp could be reduced significantly even as debt continues to rise.

the impact of bitcoin price relative to the dollar isn’t necessarily a one way street.  the saylor story may take longer than we’re talking about.

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today’s 118k price is scary high, especially if you’re used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don’t look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn’t find one, unless you look back in history… lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it’s relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i’m on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc…) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850’s) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc — thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven’t heard from ai) hey all — long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i’m coming from and what i’m considering. i’ve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
• i contributed to my school district’s 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory — terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn’t appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
• i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there’s a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1–2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
• separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that’s being paid down aggressively.
• now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i’m seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i’d put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
• i’ve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don’t gamble, pay down debt, don’t lever into volatile assets. i get that. i’m asking this community for perspectives i haven’t considered — practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
• i believe in bitcoin’s long-term thesis — adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it’s likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
• i really don’t want to liquidate my existing btc position — emotionally and strategically i’d rather hold. that’s why i’m considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
• i’m disciplined on repayment timelines and i’m comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i’m trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you’d known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i’m considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this — how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says “don’t gamble.” i’m looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i’m curious about: partial loan → partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced — stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who’s been through a leveraged crypto move — how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
• i’m not asking whether crypto is risky — i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
• i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i’m trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
• i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you’re going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn’t, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i’ve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i’ll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i’ll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why — so others can learn from the outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mmvy3t/been_burned_by_my_403b_borrowed_to_buy_btc/,Bitcoin,4,22,1mmvy3t,reddit,0.9345,

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the “talking points” for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: “bitcoin has no intrinsic value”. “bitcoins value is unreliable and subjective”. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, “*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop­erties that are valued by acting men.”*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of “intrinsic value”

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing. 

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.”[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok. 

the words ""intrinsic"" and “value” existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, “the philosophical definition is wrong and it’s not what intrinsic value means” is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has “intrinsic value”. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion. 

1. “subject” - any being or living thing.
2. “value judgement” - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim) 
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.) 
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently — just that we’ve never seen it happen.) 
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects. 
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects. 
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

* [speed wallet](https://www.speed.app/)
* [lnvoltz](https://lnvoltz.com/)

* [coinos](https://coinos.io/)

strike, coinos, and lnvoltz offer powerful, free apis that make it easy to integrate btc payments into your site or e-commerce store.

these are, in my opinion, the best custodial options where you can keep small weekly amounts of btc for daily spending without much concern.

for the liquid network, i like the [sideswap](https://sideswap.io/) wallet.

passkey:

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

so i figured i'd try again. went to sign up, and again i was rejected for...reasons. the only reason i tried again is because they responded to a review i left on google. but, alas, same exact issue and when i tried to reach out to their support email they sent me the same automated response i got before.

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,Bitcoin,16,14,1mnuj6g,reddit,0.841,

2. secondly i see the 51% attack or majority attack and centralised mining + hashrate control as a huge threat to bitcoin, with this control the entity can; 

- prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, effectively halting payments between users.

- reverse transactions that were completed during their control, allowing double-spending of coins (spending the same bitcoin more than once).

- exclude or reorder transactions, disrupting the normal operation of the blockchain.

- invalidate blocks found by honest miners, potentially monopolizing mining rewards.

foundry controls nearly 30% of the hashrate, ant pool controls nearly 20% and via btc controls nearly 14%. the top 3 mining pools already control roughly 57-60% of the networks total hashrate. and china controls 21% of the bitcoin hashrate globally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mo6p18/pro_btc_holder_myself_but_i_have_a_couple/,Bitcoin,0,13,1mo6p18,reddit,0.9561,118506.5836448425

2025-08-12 13:12:44,"i built a dollar cost averaging bot, here’s what i learned (and what i wish i knew earlier) years ago, i started tinkering with the idea of automating my bitcoin investments.  
not because i wanted to “beat the market”, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton — not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to “set and forget,” but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper… but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i’m sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

if anyone’s interested, i can dive deeper into:

* how multiplier dca actually works in practice
* the mistakes i made early that almost killed the project
* why i think 90% of dca bots on the market are using sub-optimal execution logic

happy to answer anything, whether it’s about the tech stack, exchange quirks, or the strategy side of dca.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mo8der/i_built_a_dollar_cost_averaging_bot_heres_what_i/,Bitcoin,9,26,1mo8der,reddit,-0.4632,119166.56754782684

but for you, what contributes most to the growth, adoption, and popularization of bitcoin is spending it or keeping it?

i don't think there are good bitcoiners on one side and bad ones on the other, but i still wonder about the impact that small btc holders can have.

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let’s suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don’t want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france’s reputation for *la révolution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i’m only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,Bitcoin,0,0,1moaozn,reddit,0.9432,

2025-08-12 15:04:03,"how to easily integrate bitcoin payments & donations into your web app — a step-by-step guide for the crypto community hey everyone!

i’ve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server. the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently.

if you’re curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it’s a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i’ve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:  
[**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

with that said, the other day i was thinking about the future of bitcoin and was wondering if we’ll ever get to the point where our appliances begin to mine bitcoin. most major home appliances now have some sort of computer chip in them. why not have the chip mine bitcoin while it’s in use? for instance, you wash and dry a load of clothes. when the appliance turns on, it starts to mine btc. you turn the tv on, and it starts mining. this gives security to the bitcoin network, can help offset electricity costs to run the appliance, and more. appliances like the refrigerator could constantly mine. but smaller stuff like an oven or dishwasher would mine, then kick off when the user is finished with the appliance.

isn't it technically possible for the exchange to memorize the btc adress of the non-custodial wallet you send for example 10000 sats to? so that when you send it back to the exchange, it can identify and verify that those 10000 sats are exactly the sats that you bought there for a certain price.
