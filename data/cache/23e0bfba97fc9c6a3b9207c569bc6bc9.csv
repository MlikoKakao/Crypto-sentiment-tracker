,btc,1myfr13,en,,229.0,,,,87.0,0.9593,reddit,Bitcoin,"if people are expecting a bitcoin bear market in 2026, why buy and hold now? hi all. i have a question, pretty much listed in the title. if people are expecting a bitcoin bear market in 2026, and i saw many post saying that they expect a bottom around 50k, 60k, 70k, 80k, etc. then why buy and hold right now? wouldn’t it be better to hold cash and buy when the price are lower if people are so convinced that will happen?

i mean it makes sense if your plan is to buy now and hold until it reaches the top (the top in your opinion), and sell to get more cash so you can buy more in the bear market. but 1. that would be trying to time the market, and people usually suggest don’t do that for good reason. 2. people are not saying they would sell at the presumed top, but just buy and hold. 

so i am just confused- it seems that it would be contradictory to both believe a bear market/a substantial price drop and also believe buy and hold right now. can someone please explain the logic behind such a combination of thoughts? or that people don’t believe these two things in the same time, just different people believe different things.

right now i have like 80% of my money in bitcoin and bitcoin etfs, and 20% cash. i am fully onboard on the fiat money printing - your usd is going to forever lose value thing, and that’s why i am in bitcoin. but if i believe next year the bitcoin would crash to 70-80k, i would not feel comfortable holding right now. call it trying to time the market if you want but still. like i don’t want to hold stocks if i know it will enter a bear market at a fixed time and the price will be way below current price. i hold stocks because i don’t know when the bear market will be and time in the market beats timing the market.

hopefully i expressed myself clearly. appreciate your thoughts on this in advance.",2025-08-23 23:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1myfr13/if_people_are_expecting_a_bitcoin_bear_market_in/,115255.13161262068,115114.36965872673,,80.43782594420159,21.721784259643755,-0.8602231059614427,22.582007365605197

i need some help. this is my first time posting on reddit and building a project, and i am looking for your insights and opinions, so please go easy on me. i apologize for the long read.

i have been interested in crypto (especially bitcoin and dogecoin since the election). i have been looking for crypto news but i have always found them either biased, too much data , quantitative metrics and at times confusing and sometimes, some ai regurgitated news. none of them personalize the news to your interests or portfolio and none of them fetch and feed the news which is actually valuable or needed. i feel most of the time people skim through twitter/reddit to find news which is good enough to spend money on.

so i thought what if i made a tool which could use ai to go through all crypto platforms, news platforms too, reddit , twitter, you name it.. and give you unbiased news based on your personalized interests which you can customize. basically filters news, alerts, noise and narratives based on your preferences (coins, sectors, nfts, defi, etc.)

so i started building a small project to solve this for myself, and i’d love your thoughts:

(1) pulls news from twitter, reddit, crypto sites, etc.

(2) filters it based on your interests (coins, nfts, defi, sectors).

(3) flags critical alerts early (narratives, tokens, regulations).

(4) uses ai to explain "" why it matters "" and give risk/reward confidence scores.

(5) sends a short daily newsletter with your personal highlights in plain english, not jargon.

i want to show what news was (1) detected , (2) why it matters and what (3) action you should take clearly! early alerts on narratives, tokens, or sectors you care about. i am trying to make it easily digestible for casual investors like me and actionable with confidence scores + plain-language explanations. i want to give risk/reward with confidence levels for each alert.

the most important part is that the news is simply not some bullshit summary, but analyzes, predicts, flags critical alerts, sends a daily email newsletter with your highlights, so you don’t have to scroll endless feeds.

my goal is to build not just another crypto newsletter, but something personalized, actionable (confidence levels, risks/rewards) and digestible for casual investors like me.

but i don’t know if i’m solving a real problem or just building a “meh” project.

since this is my first attempt, i’d really value your thoughts:

would something like this be useful to you?

what part feels valuable vs. “just noise”?

what would make you actually use or subscribe to a tool like this?

i’m not looking for customers right now, just validation and honest feedback (even if you think it’s dumb, please tell me).

i also made a mock landing page + dashboard preview so people can see what it might look like (not live yet, just a prototype). i know this is a bit premature, but i thought why not!

i would like to thank everyone for taking the time to read this fully and i thank any comments for my project.

**key points:**

* the us government is hiding the true value of gold, estimated to be $863 billion, and is instead using a book value of $11 billion.

about a year ago, i was helping a friend search for a bitcoin mining site, and i quickly realized how inefficient spreadsheets were for modeling profitability. they were slow and not very flexible when we wanted to test different scenarios.

that experience pushed me to start building this **bitcoin mining calculator**.

here’s what it currently does:

* works with **any asic miner model** you choose
* calculates **monthly profit, roi, and payback period**
* uses **live data** for btc price, network hashrate, and difficulty
* gives you a clear picture of how much you can potentially earn

it’s designed to be much faster and easier than spreadsheets.

the link to the calculator [https://calc.hashinsight.net/](https://calc.hashinsight.net/)

i’d love to hear feedback from this community — would this kind of tool be useful for you?  
i’m also working on adding more advanced features to better support miners’ needs.

born in an era when no one understood it, it grew up in obscurity, alone.

without state protection or bank backing,

there were only a few ""children"" who believed in it, typing away line after line of code at their keyboards, building nodes, and sowing faith.



some laughed at it, calling it a bubble;

some called it a scam.

but it simply continued silently, like a mute child, letting time alone answer all questions.



i longed to pull a ""future financial prediction machine"" from my pocket and tell the person who bought it for a few cents:

""don't be afraid. in the future, countless people will stay up late, research, and work hard for it.

it will be called 'digital gold' and may even change the world's concept of currency.""



but i know that growth cannot be cheated.

btc's story is like nobita's—stumbling, facing disfavor, yet never giving up.



now, it has grown up.

standing on the world stage, it is still questioned, still regulated, and still at the center of the storm.

but do you know?

it was never meant to be understood by everyone. it's simply to allow a small number of people to see another possibility.



if you're still holding on,

you may feel lonely, or think your ideal is too far-fetched.

but remember,

some changes aren't meant to be accomplished in a single generation.



i don't have a ""get-rich-quick pill"" or a ""wealth time machine.""

but i'll be with you, watching it continue to grow and the world slowly awaken.

my plan is to go *all in* on bitcoin during this time. i already have a ledger wallet, but i’m also considering a trezor model t (bitcoin-only) for redundancy and peace of mind. a bit of background: i first entered the space in 2021 - not directly through bitcoin, but through the broader crypto hype (mainly metaverse projects). since then, i’ve been on and off, but now i really want to focus seriously on bitcoin and build conviction.

here’s how i’m thinking about it: even if bitcoin doesn’t perform as expected in the short term, i’ll still be starting my finance career in three years at the same point as my peers. the difference is that if it *does* work out, i’ll have an early and concentrated position. given my career trajectory, i’ll also have strong earning potential later, so i view this as a calculated risk.

my questions:

* what resources (books, articles, podcasts, courses) would you recommend to truly understand bitcoin’s economics, technology, and history?
* for someone who studies finance, which aspects of bitcoin are most important to dig into (monetary policy, security model, macro impact, etc.)?
* from your experience, is “going all in” at this stage a reasonable strategy, or would you recommend a different approach to accumulation and risk management?

i’d really value perspectives from those who’ve built long-term conviction in bitcoin, especially people with a finance background who can relate to this way of thinking.

i didn’t really check on it much until it started making headlines everywhere. i still remember sitting on the bus on my way to school, looking at the digital screens by the bus stops that were showing the news: “bitcoin hits a new all-time high of $18k per coin…”

back then, i knew i had put some money in, but i wasn’t too bothered about it. as the price kept climbing, i decided to sell half of my bitcoin holdings when it reached around $30k per coin. i used the gains to buy into other cryptocurrencies, which some of i still hold today. one of them performed really well and even paid for a two-month vacation, so i can’t complain—though i do sometimes regret selling that bitcoin early.

overall, it was my first real introduction to the world of crypto. now i’m 25, and i’ve built the habit of buying bitcoin weekly.

i know it might sound like a common story, but in my case it’s true: around 8 years ago i lost the **second password** to my [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com) wallet. back then, there was the main password to log in, and a second one (like a security pin) required to **send funds**.

the issue is that without that second password, i can log in and see my balance, but i can’t move anything. at the time, i had about **0.34 btc**, which didn’t hurt too much back then… but today it’s quite a significant amount, so i’m wondering if there’s *any* chance of recovery.

i already contacted blockchain support, but they basically said they **can’t do anything** and referred me to some **external team** that supposedly handles this kind of recovery… but honestly, it doesn’t sound very trustworthy.

does anyone know if there’s a **legitimate way** to recover the funds, or should i just accept them as lost forever?  
any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

cheers!

it’s not a real mining app, just a game that simulates the idea of starting with a tiny rig and scaling up over time.

core loop:

* start with a basic mining rig
* upgrade hardware to boost hashrate
* prestige for long-term multipliers
* (coming soon) leaderboards

the game is currently in **closed beta on android**, free to play. if anyone here enjoys idle/clicker games, i’d really appreciate feedback on the pacing, balance, or ideas for bitcoin-related features that could make it more fun.

how to join:  
step 1: join the google testers group (required for play store closed betas)

most people don’t realize how deadly unemployment actually is.

📉 research going back decades shows that in the u.s., every **1 percentage point increase in unemployment** is linked to around **37,000–47,500 extra deaths per year**.

* causes range from heart disease and stress-related illness to suicides, overdoses, and even higher homicide rates.
* one long-term study found that working-age men’s mortality risk rises **6% for each 1% uptick** in local unemployment.
* an older breakdown even estimated the “extra deaths” as \~20k heart attacks, \~900 suicides, \~650 homicides.

📊 right now (july 2025), the u.s. unemployment rate is **4.2%** — steady compared to last year. for context: south dakota is at just **1.9%**, while d.c. sits at **6.0%**.

📈 and here’s where bitcoin ties in:

* strong job reports = investors feel safer → bitcoin tends to pump.
* rising unemployment = more uncertainty → investors flee risk → bitcoin can dip.
* btc isn’t isolated; it lives and breathes with the same macro currents that drive equities, bonds, and risk assets.

so the dark truth is: unemployment doesn’t just hit wallets — it kills people. and at the same time, it shapes bitcoin’s price action.",2025-08-24 16:25:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mz03ea/unemployment_literally_kills_tens_of_thousands/,114420.77415857486,114593.51326769509,114923.51128162834,28.92710859252776,-145.60135917784646,-144.88353288334264,-0.7178262945038227

at the beginning, dogecoin was just a joke, shiba a community, pepe an internet meme. today, we’re seeing entire political families turning their image into crypto projects.

it’s both fascinating and worrying:

fascinating, because it shows how deeply crypto has entered the public imagination, to the point where politics is now using it as a communication tool.

worrying, because many people may invest out of loyalty or ideology rather than real analysis.


i want to particularly mention the world liberty financial (wlfi) project. apparently, there’s a group tied to trump that first entered crypto by investing in bitcoin, ethereum, and others, and now they’re pushing their own token. trump already had a “memecoin” with his name, his wife also launched one under her name, and now they’re going further with wlfi.
what struck me is the speed: some exchanges already launched it in pre-market, and even in futures (bitget, for instance). it’s no longer just about “listing,” it jumps straight to derivatives.

and it makes me wonder: maybe crypto will never grow beyond influence — whether it’s political figures, celebrities, or ct influencers. influence itself is becoming the raw material of new tokens.

i don’t know if i’m wrong here, but does anyone else see, like me, a dangerous drift that mixes politics too much with decentralized finance?",2025-08-24 17:35:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mz1ys9/when_political_figures_turn_their_influence_into/,114260.77681740143,114475.73185446551,114834.70044642594,11.843344769298412,-144.9084304417629,-142.97123420175447,-1.9371962400084328

post:
just bought 5 eth (~29k €) and now i’m thinking about what to add next to my portfolio. at the moment i hold ~30k usdc and ~6 eth, total around 60k in crypto. my plan is to slowly increase exposure up to 200–300k, but i don’t want to risk putting everything only into eth. i’m considering whether it makes sense to buy some btc as a more stable long-term base, or diversify into altcoins like link, sol, avax, hbar or maybe even newer projects with potential. at the same time, i wonder if staking usdc for 5–12% yield is worth the risk compared to just keeping it liquid for buying dips. i’m aiming for a 1–3 year horizon, so i want growth but also some security. what would you recommend as the next step in my situation?",2025-08-24 18:18:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mz34nw/bought_5_eth_what_next/,114626.65293065342,114457.70675702451,114801.60091200286,64.29238289676351,-115.13383639797394,-137.80972723128494,22.675890833311

1. **profit-taking at highs** – a lot of people locked in gains after the big rally. pretty normal after aths.
2. **fed + jackson hole uncertainty** – traders are waiting on powell’s speech. if he sounds hawkish, risk assets like btc get shaky.
3. **leverage flush** – over **$270m in long positions** got liquidated. once support levels broke, it snowballed.
4. **etf flow slowdown** – institutional demand through spot etfs cooled off a bit, so less fresh buying power.
