2025-08-09 15:41:25,"are we sleeping on the infrastructure projects that ai and robotics will need? 
full disclosure, i do not own any meaningful bags in either three of the projects that i’m going to mention.   i’ve been watching projects such as aioz network, aleph cloud, and arweave, and i can’t shake the feeling these could be the backbone of robotics and ai in the real world.

aioz has partnerships with alibaba cloud, nvidia, neo blockchain, qualcomm, and google for startups. its decentralized streaming, ai compute, and storage could power robotics systems that need to process and share huge amounts of data in real time without depending on one central server.

aleph cloud is already working with ubisoft and hyperswap and has a $1m accelerator for new projects. its multi-chain “supercloud” with private compute, dynamic storage, and upcoming gpu power could give robots and ai agents secure, low-latency access to the computing resources they need anywhere in the world.

arweave is permanent decentralized storage, already used by major organizations. for robotics, it could mean keeping critical training data, operational logs, and ai models stored forever and instantly accessible without the risk of losing it if a company shuts down a server.

if robotics and automation are going to be everywhere in factories, logistics, healthcare, and homes, don’t we need exactly these kinds of decentralized and resilient systems to keep them running?

so why aren’t these moving? is it just too early for the market to catch up, or am i missing something? i’d love to hear from people with backgrounds in computer science, ai, robotics, or coding who can explain the gap, because to me this looks like inevitable infrastructure for the future.

tl;dr: aioz, aleph cloud, and arweave seem like critical building blocks for real-world robotics and ai from compute to streaming to permanent storage, yet the market’s seemingly ignoring them. what am i missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mlshja/are_we_sleeping_on_the_infrastructure_projects/,10,38,1mlshja,reddit,0.6264,4208.442848172166

but also... timing feels weird? we're barely into the new admin and key crypto people are already leaving? makes me wonder if there's some behind the scenes drama...

what's the play here? does this change anything for the whole strategic bitcoin reserve narrative or just standard washington shuffling?

curious what you guys think - market doesn't seem to care much right now but wondering if this matters more than it looks

the market’s pretty unfazed so far—most traders and whales seem to think it’s just typical political churn, not a sign of the admin backing off its crypto roadmap. with interagency teams and new reports dropping, momentum looks solid, but the main drama is: will the next director actually get the reserve built, or will it stay all talk?.

btw, i use awaken.tax for tracking trades and tax filing—it flagged nothing unusual from the political side except more buzz about reporting on government crypto moves. if you’re trying to log your own trades, stuff like these leadership switches don’t impact direct filings, but it’s worth watching if policy shifts mean new reporting requirements down the line, especially if congress pushes for full transparency on wallet holdings and acquisition methods. anyone else seeing updates or alerts from their tax platforms since this whole shake-up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mm0vjc/crypto_council_director_bo_hines_steps_downgood/,0,4,1mm0vjc,reddit,0.9328,4284.838916253817

[cryptocurrency group claims credit for wnba 'dildogate'](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/bernadette-giacomazzo/cryptocurrency-group-claims-credit-for-wnba-dildogate)

  
a self-described cryptocurrency enthusiast has claimed that his online cryptocurrency community coordinated the recent sex-toy tosses that disrupted multiple [wnba](https://www.complex.com/tag/wnba) games, saying the stunts were designed to promote a coin the group created.

the man, who uses the handle “lt. daldo raine,” spoke anonymously to [espn](https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45923322/crypto-group-says-orchestrated-sex-toy-tosses-wnba-games) over a video conference, kept his camera off, and declined to share his name or age.

he said the coin began trading on july 28—one day before the first incident on july 29, [when a green sex toy was thrown during the atlanta dream–golden state valkyries game](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/bernadette-giacomazzo/wnba-game-halted-by-fan-throwing-a-very-nsfw-object-at-players), leading to a fourth-quarter postponement.

play

espn reviewed posts from the group’s telegram channel, which had more than 1,000 users, that featured advanced chatter, a link to the game stream, and celebratory comments. a wnba spokesperson declined to comment on the claim.

wnbpa executive director terri jackson said the union requested an update and was told the league is investigating whether individuals were incentivized to participate.

two arrests have followed. delbert carver, 23, of marietta, georgia, was arrested aug. 1 in connection with a toss at the end of a dream–phoenix mercury game and faces counts including disorderly conduct, public indecency/indecent exposure, and criminal trespass.

police say he tried to flee and admitted to throwing the first object on july 29; the crypto source said carver isn’t affiliated with the group and wasn’t the original thrower.

also on aug. 1, another green object was tossed during the chicago sky–valkyries game. [player sophie cunningham posted on x](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/sophie-cunningham-wnba-fans-stop-throwing-dildos-court), “stop throwing dildos on the court.”

coordinated attempts continued tuesday across four arenas. in phoenix, 18-year-old kaden lopez was arrested after a throw that hit two spectators, including a minor; he faces misdemeanor disorderly conduct and assault after a felony count was dropped.

a planned attempt in seattle did not occur. the wnba reiterated that anyone who throws an object will be ejected and face a minimum one-year ban, with potential arrest and prosecution.

since july 29, the coin’s price has climbed about 300%, google searches for “green dildo” have spiked 3,700%, and at least one sportsbook offered prop bets that group members allegedly exploited. the group says it will pivot away from wnba games to less disruptive stunts, citing a sighting at a marlins–astros mlb game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mm3odt/cryptocurrency_group_claims_credit_for_wnba/,0,5,1mm3odt,reddit,-0.9372,4265.188124390236

i want to share something bullish about ada. this chart shows cardano when measured in xrp. cardano has lost 93% of its value relative to xrp since early 2021 as 1 ada is now equal to less than 0.25 xrp. this isn't a shitpost on ada. it's bullish because it means ada is undervalued relative to xrp. years of underperformance now the create the conditions for a reversal on this chart. i do expect ada to outperform xrp going forward. the charts is also at a multi-year support level of 0.25 xrp. we have seen big bounces from this level in the past and i expect to see it again as ada approaches $5+

some might say this chart has no significance. but i disagree. remember when everyone on this sub was mega bearish on eth back in april....well we saw eth/btc hit key support levels and now a rapid v-shape recovery. this wasn't a coincidence:

from 0.025 to 0.036 in the eth/btc ratio.

granted, there are a lot more projects up and running now, but we have seen the first step, which is eth start to rise accordingly. should history rhyme, eth will continue to out-perform the market leader for another period of time, until the markets become euphoric and we enter the alt-season.

buy eth on binance, send on-chain to uniswap wallet, and swap for whatever tokens i’m interested in.

so my question is…

is it safe to then send these tokens to my cold wallets for storage, or is there a risk the tokens themselves when bought, and sent on-chain to a cold wallet could somehow drain the cold wallet?

or is the only risk when i’m doing the actual swaps in uniswap wallet?

i’m trying to understand the danger of malicious contracts and at what point they can steal your funds. my understanding so far is the risk is only there when doing the actual swap.

2025-08-10 12:31:02,"after 5 years in crypto trading, i finally ""made it"" - here's what actually worked i started trading crypto in 2018. like many, i got in with zero experience, thinking i’d get rich fast. spoiler: i didn’t.

bought trx, xrp, and a bunch of random altcoins. lost $2,700 in a few months. then i tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. honestly, i almost quit.

in 2019, i decided to stop gambling and start learning. i studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. i didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

by 2020, i was finally making small profits. took only setups i trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. made around $4,800 on a $3k account. nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? i was ready. i grew my account to over $43k trading eth, sol, and a few strong alts. but i got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. that lesson hurt, but it stuck.

2022 was survival mode. i traded less, avoided trying to “buy the dip,” and focused on capital preservation. profits were small, but i didn’t lose.

from 2023 to now, i’ve kept it boring: 1% risk per trade, only 2–3 reliable setups, and strict journaling. i don’t trade every day. i don’t chase pumps. i just stick to what works.

in 2024, i crossed $100k in my trading account. no moonshots. just consistency over time.

tl;dr

lost money in 2018 (like most beginners) started learning & tracking everything in 2019 profitable by 2020, stayed consistent bull run helped, but greed punished me in 2021 focused on capital protection in 2022 2023–2025: steady growth, no drama finally passed $100k in 2024 biggest lessons:

you won’t get rich overnight. risk management > everything. you don’t need to trade every day. journaling your trades = free edge. survive long enough, and your edge will show up. happy to answer questions if anyone’s stuck in the early phase like i was. stay in the game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mmhcfi/after_5_years_in_crypto_trading_i_finally_made_it/,326,168,1mmhcfi,reddit,0.7556,4184.841144305349

over the last few days, the charts have been buzzing. ethereum is now pushing towards the $4,000 mark, just a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time highs. if eth breaks through, history tells us that altcoin season could follow quickly.

here’s what i’m watching:

bitcoin holding strong above $150k, stability is a green light for alt growth.

ethereum only ~$500 away from ath, breakout potential is huge.

altcoins like xrp starting to show signs of life, but the real momentum is yet to come.

2025-08-11 00:30:56,"343k aethweth lost (fake aave ads) today a single victim lost about 343k worth of aethweth due to signing a malicious signature. this is yet another phishing scam where the user was tricked into giving approval access to aave eth.

below are the affected wallets:

* 0x8f4dd47f9cff6b2af1ef0be7ad2263e5784b64d7 - victim
* 0x96041e71aef1499f2ff8cad14bcbf419d2dea73a - malicious contract
* 0x0be1ced347b9cae3a21feb1e416813092b6da144 - drainer admin
* 0x321d42288d1585a2dd03f0b59a81b69e0292f71f - drainer customer

there's a few unique instances about this particular drain that lead me to post about it. 

the first is that this appears to be the work of inferno/angel drainer. 

# inferno/angel drainer

inferno drainer was acquired by angel drainer in oct 2024 for an undisclosed sum. 

[the telegram message coming from the inferno drainer team announcing the intent to hand over their source code to angel drainer.](https://preview.redd.it/togynmomz9if1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=c24e2aef6757bd6449325a4e0c7db46952f2f792)

the acquisition was announced about a year after inferno drainer ""claimed"" to have shutdown. we now know that to be false.

the wallet 0x0be1c.....a144 is an inferno/angel admin wallet that's about two weeks old. when inferno drainer was operating as it's own entity, these wallets tend to get rotated every 6 - 8 months. 

now, most likely due to anti-phishing technology catching up to drainer methods, i'm starting to see these wallets getting rotated every 2 - 3 weeks. 

additionally, instead of the wallet drain taking place in one transaction, on-chain evidence shows there's 12 that happen simultaneously. i spot checked another contract from the admin wallet and it also showed 12 separate transactions.

[above is an example of what happens on-chain when a user gives token approval. funds from the user's wallet go to 0x960...ea73a - the malicious contract operated by inferno\/angel drainer and then are split between the admin and the drainer customer.](https://preview.redd.it/cdnf6ecg2aif1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4ca74885f018b66a7769d1c0a539cf07b0100d)

the use of multiple transactions vs doing it all at once is also something i haven't seen before. this was done presumably to stay off the radar of anti-phishing efforts as well.

# how did this scam happen?

it appears this particular user most likely clicked on a fake aave eth link from a google search result. 

i looked at some community reported thefts coming from the inferno/angel admin wallet of 0x0be1c.....a144 and noticed similar patterns. all of the reported thefts appear to be coming from fake aave websites.

aave had an influx of scammer activity days after hitting the milestone of 60 billion in deposits since launch. the scammers used google ads to mimiic aave by creating a website with the same branding and made it look as ""official as possible"".

[above is an example of a malicious website targeting users who search for \\""aave\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7u1tugmh5aif1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dad12d2d9399cac8e5abef91cb38314b8b2ab6)

unfortunately, these malicious ads tend to be on the top of the google search results for terms like ""aave"" or ""aave smart contract"". 

the user who lost 343k may of been searching for the official aave website and came across a similar one that clearly was a scam. 

once token approval access was given, the aethweth was quickly moved to the malicious contract and the stolen funds were split between inferno/angel drainer and the customer.

# following the funds

as of this moment, the user's stolen crypto is all accounted for. inside the inferno/angel admin wallet, the aethweth was swapped to eth where it currently sits. these funds will eventually get siphoned off to other wallets controlled by inferno/angel, laundered, and then hit a deposit address.

whenever a large amount of crypto is moved to the customer's wallet, they tend to move the funds very quickly. all of the aethweth here was also swapped to eth and moved to the decentralized wallet of 0x38f3a4b7ed737fb64590be61fab5f11e74c3623d.

[above is a visualization of the funds from the user's wallet --\> malicious contract --\> drainer admin & customer wallets. so far no money laundering has taken place yet.](https://preview.redd.it/dzxb7dgzaaif1.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c6d2ffd92420de6503fe8f71cf6885f8a94bc01)

i'm sure there will be more movement of the funds in the coming days.

unfortunately, that will take a while to process. our pals at robinhood are happy for you to buy as much as you like through their platform, but ... outbound transfers of crypto are capped at $5k every 24 hours. 



completely arbitrary. substantially pointless, given the technological and financial sophistication of most of their marketplace. i asked for an exception, and they denied it. i asked whether there was a person i could appeal this decision to, and got this:



""i understand your frustration. however, the $5,000 daily crypto withdrawal limit is a system-wide policy and cannot be appealed or manually adjusted by robinhood support or management. this limit is determined automatically based on account activity and verification, and there is no process to request an exception or appeal. you can continue transferring up to your daily limit until your full balance is moved. if you have questions about how to transfer or need help with the process, i’m here to assist.""

  
so if you're stacking at robinhood, and you're considering moving your crypto to self-custody (or anywhere!), be careful. you could be looking at months of daily transfers ahead of you if/when you shift.

2025-08-11 07:02:18,"long-term diamond hands only: your top 3 altcoins for the next 5+ years alright fam, let’s play a little thought experiment.
imagine you’re locked in for the next 5+ years. no flipping, no panic selling, no chasing the next hype coin. you pick three altcoins… and that’s it. through bull runs, bear markets, and all the sideways boredom in between – you hold.

which three make the cut for you? and more importantly – why?

here’s my forever bag (at least for now):

1. ondo
yeah, i know it’s not everyone’s first thought, but hear me out. ondo is carving out a spot in real-world asset tokenization – basically bringing traditional finance products into the crypto world in a tokenized form. if this sector blows up (and i think it will), ondo could be right there at the front. it’s early, it’s risky, but i like the upside.

2. chainlink (link)
link is that quiet but critical infrastructure project. without oracles, defi as we know it just wouldn’t work. and link isn’t just sitting still – ccip (cross-chain interoperability protocol) could be massive for connecting different blockchains. in my eyes, link is like the plumbing of web3. not flashy, but essential.

3. ethereum (eth)
the og smart contract platform. eth is still where most of the action happens – defi, nfts, daos, you name it. with upgrades like the merge behind us and more scalability improvements coming, i think eth will keep its top spot for years. sure, competitors will pop up, but eth has that network effect and developer community that’s hard to beat.

⸻

now, i’m not saying these three are perfect. anything can happen in crypto. but when i think long-term, i like having a mix of:
	•	adoption potential (ondo)
	•	critical infrastructure (link)
	•	proven backbone (eth)

what about you? do you go safe with blue chips like eth, bnb, ada? or are you throwing darts at the next potential 100x microcap? maybe a mix – one safe bet, two moonshots?

i’d love to hear your reasoning. even if you think my picks are trash, tell me what you’d replace them with and why. bonus points if you’ve actually survived holding through a full bear market before – those war stories are always fun to read.

so… what’s in your forever bag?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mn64ug/longterm_diamond_hands_only_your_top_3_altcoins/,77,206,1mn64ug,reddit,0.9946,4299.852990702404

2025-08-11 08:57:44,"how to take profits like a pro during the upcoming crypto run. there are roughly 4 phases during the bull run. they might overlap with each other for a while.

1. btc pumps, the rest just sucks ft. eth. any coin vs. btc (pair) is tanking, nobody is excited except the btc maxis cause 99% degens on this sub own alts.
2. eth wakes up (+- current situation) and we have a gigantic volatility on eth/btc chart, money moves between those 2 + some major alts. eth folks, after being ridiculed for year(s) with btc/eth charts, start to get some confidence and we get the classical flippening yelling. eth is gonna flip/overtake btc (which of course will never happen)
3. eth season is done and we have a situation where money flows from eth into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). there will be several cycles, not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump. alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping.
4. finally, once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

the latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into btc again. the alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ath (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

you also don't keep all of your converted btc when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for fiat (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. you can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 10-20% apy while your fiat gets you close to zero apy when you move it to your bankster's place.

once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy btc again because nobody is buying btc at atl except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top = ath hopefully) and finally 25% that's left for one last profit taking.

basically, you sell gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto and sell heavily +- 50% of your bag when you feel that this is gonna be as good as it gets (you'll never get the top so anything close to it = before and/or after ath is great).

i'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. ok, bye.

2025-08-11 11:53:26,"in a blockchain (l1, pos) workflow, how significant are block times really? i understand that finality is the product of several components working together: consensus, execution, networking, and state synchronization. from what i’ve seen, block time is often treated as a shorthand for performance, but in practice it’s only one piece of the puzzle.

from a user experience perspective, economic finality is what really matters, the point at which a transaction is so irreversible that it can be relied upon for financial settlement. this makes me wonder where block time actually fits in that bigger picture. does a shorter block time meaningfully reduce the time to finality, or is it overshadowed by other factors like network latency, consensus rounds, or validator performance?

i’ve been noticing a lot of people using block time as a headline metric when comparing “fastest” chains today. is that a fair or useful comparison, or should we be focusing more on end-to-end finality metrics instead? would love to hear perspectives from those who’ve worked on or benchmarked different networks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mnavyc/in_a_blockchain_l1_pos_workflow_how_significant/,8,6,1mnavyc,reddit,0.2216,4183.1480554203945
2025-08-11 13:37:46,"would you invest in post-quantum cryptos if they hit tier 1 exchanges? quantum computers are getting closer to breaking ecdsa, the lowest-hanging fruit in crypto security. if that happens, roughly 25% of bitcoin wallets could be at risk.

we don’t know exactly when a powerful enough quantum computer will be built, but it’s clear that it will happen sooner or later. most current blockchains, including bitcoin and ethereum, would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. efforts are underway to upgrade these blockchains, but it’s a challenging process that will take time — and there’s no guarantee the fixes will be ready before the threat becomes real.

it’s worth noting that there are already post-quantum cryptocurrencies designed to withstand this risk from the start. they use quantum-safe signature schemes like xmss or sphincs+, which cannot be broken by shor’s algorithm. a few of these coins are live today, but most are only available on small, niche exchanges with low liquidity.  


**questions for you:**

1. should quantum-resistant cryptos be listed on tier 1 exchanges like binance, coinbase, or kraken?   
a) yes  
b) no

2. after such a listing, i would:  
a) stick to mainstream crypto only, so no impact to me.  
b) add quantum-resistant crypto to my portfolio as a hedge against a black swan event.

2025-08-11 15:38:48,"the crypto anarchist manifesto a specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name, or legal identity, of the other. interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. these developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

the technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. the methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. the focus has until now been on academic conferences in europe and the u.s., conferences monitored closely by the national security agency. but only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. and the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. high-speed networks, isdn, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, ku-band transmitters, multi-mips personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

the state will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. an anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of cryptonet. but this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. and just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier west, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

2025-08-11 20:56:10,"why stablecoins make sense even if you don’t think you need them think of stablecoins like the “pause button” for your crypto money. they’re pegged to something steady like the us dollar, so when the rest of the market is swinging around, they hold their value. that’s why people often use them when they want to step out of the volatility without fully cashing out into a bank account.  
  
a lot of people still stick to the old playbook, holding stablecoins, waiting for a big dip, then swooping in to buy their favorite assets cheap. but the game is changing and honestly a wise crypto holder needs to see that. these days, stables aren’t just a parking spot anymore. they can actually work harder than some of the hyped tokens out there.  
  
right now, just holding some of it in spot account ( like normal bitget spot or maybe bybit) gives up 10% apr. that’s without doing anything extra. and if you happen to hit $500 in daily trading volume, that rate can climb to 15% apr.  
  
as for how companies like circle, the usdc issuer, make money, it’s simple. when you give them a dollar for usdc, they hold that dollar or a safe equivalent like treasury bills. those dollars can earn interest in traditional financial markets, and that interest is part of their profit. you still get your 1:1 peg, they get yield from the reserve.  
  
so the point isn’t that stablecoins are better than dollars, it’s that they give you flexibility. you can hold them, earn on them, trade with them instantly, or send them anywhere in the world in seconds without touching a bank. and if you play it right, like with many of them like $usdt, $usdc or $gho yield options in some exchanges, your patience in crypto doesn’t have to mean sitting still. your stack can grow in the background so that when the time comes to act, you’re stepping in with more than you started with. personally, i see the promise, but i’m cautious. a lot of what’s happening right now still feels tied to timing, hype, and market mood rather than consistent performance. the tech is interesting, but i’m not sure yet if it’s a lasting structural shift or just the newest narrative running its course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnoxi7/why_stablecoins_make_sense_even_if_you_dont_think/,6,9,1mnoxi7,reddit,0.9961,4250.361664112012

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, samson mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

secomd, willy woo called bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

the real question isn't whether eth can pump another 12% to hit its ath. it's whether bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. and for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype. either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnw5pl/eth_vs_btc_what_is_the_reality/,28,36,1mnw5pl,reddit,0.9886,4271.345199504628

2025-08-12 07:55:25,"[guide] ethereum node types explained (and why they can make or break your debugging) ever had an `eth_call` work perfectly one day… then fail the next?  
or a `debug_tracecall` that times out for no clear reason?  
chances are — it wasn’t your code. it was your **node**.

over the last few months, i’ve been writing deep dives on ethereum development. from decoding raw transactions and exploring eip-1559 & eip-4844 to working with eip-7702 and building real transactions in go.  
this post is a natural next step: understanding the **nodes** that actually run and simulate those transactions.

in this guide, you’ll learn:

* **full, archive, and light nodes** — what they store, what they don’t, and why it matters for your work
* why `eth_call` might fail for historical blocks
* why `debug_tracecall` works on one rpc but fails on another
* how **execution clients** handle calls differently
* when running your own node makes sense (and what it will cost you)

**key takeaway:**  
your node type and client decide what data you actually get back and that can make or break your debugging, tracing, and historical lookups.

if you’ve ever hit:

* `missing trie node` errors
* traces that mysteriously fail
* calls that work locally but not in prod

this post explains exactly why.

2025-08-12 11:56:15,"circle, tether, stripe… why is every payments company spinning up its own l1? there’s a real push right now for payments companies to own the base layer for settlement.

1. circle just unveiled an in-house l1 called arc. it’s evm-compatible, uses usdc for gas, has a built-in stablecoin fx engine, aims for sub-second finality, and is slated for a public testnet this fall.

2. next, on the tether side, we’re seeing tether-centric l1s rather than an official tether chain. plasma is a bitfinex-backed network targeting zero-fee usdt transfers, with recent raises and a coming mainnet. there’s also stable, an l1 that raised $28 million to make usdt native for gas and settlement.

3. stripe is reportedly building an l1 called tempo with paradigm. this came via a now-removed job posting and some media reporting, so it’s not formally announced yet.

the pattern i'm seeing here is: if you’re a payments or stablecoin company, ""controlling"" your own chain means you can tune fees, performance, and compliance features, and especially capture more of the stack than if you stay a tenant on someone else’s.

last january i decided to take a more serious look at cold storage. i had heard about [ledger](https://www.ledger.com/what-is-a-crypto-wallet) for years but never really spent the time to understand how it worked. after exploring their site the way they explained their ecosystem really clicked for me. hardware wallets built with secure element chips, a custom operating system, and transaction signing that never exposes private keys to the internet. it was the first time i truly felt like i had complete self custody without sacrificing too much convenience in day to day use.

i have seen ledger mentioned a lot more over the past year and so far my experience has been very positive. updates have been smooth and i have had no issues. the peace of mind alone makes it worth it for me.

flash forward to today, i have been trying my hand at api trading and i wanted to try something, run the same exact algo (same pairs, same parameters, same everything) on three exchanges, bitget, binance, and okx and see how they compare.

what i found surprised me. the strategy traded differently on each exchange. one gave me slightly better entries and slightly higher returns. the differences were small per trade, but after a few dozen trades they accumulated. binance and okx were close to each other, while bitget outperformed them in my case.

i am guessing factors like liquidity, order book depth, and execution speed played a big role here, especially with certain altcoin pairs.

this isn’t going to be a rerun of the early 2020s. this feels like 2014 and 2017 all over again, only bigger. the big money players are stepping into the arena. private equity cash injections are flowing in. institutional money is in the game. crypto is more established, adoption is broader, and the perceived risk has dropped.

just look at ethereum. the move from $1.7k to $4.5k is nothing compared to what’s ahead. that’s a mere ripple in the ocean. the real tidal wave hasn’t even formed yet.

donald trump jr is the keynote speaker at korea blockchain week 2025. charles hoskinson and justin sun are also speaking.

i checked three times. it's still real. i'm not saying it's weird ...but i want to go to korea to see for myself. (also tomasz stańczak, my latest work crush, is going to be there!)

you might know my work. i tell ethereum conference stories from the inside of my chaotic brain: the noise, the contradictions, the strange interactions in the hallways. i’ve covered ethprague and ethbelgrade in long-form dispatches that read more like narrative fiction than news. when i go somewhere, i try to take you with me.

**evmavericks are holding the funds** for this campaign. they won’t come with me. but they will make sure your eth does what it’s supposed to.

(eta etherscan links and l2 options)

evmavericks multi-sig wallet: [0x09a38b6187a2c44b6ba71c277c50764b5878b824](https://etherscan.io/address/0x09a38b6187a2c44b6ba71c277c50764b5878b824)

* mainnet
* base
* optimism
* polygon
* arbitrum

if the minimum amount of 0.5 eth isn’t raised by the 10th of september, all contributions will be refunded.

if it is, i go to seoul. simple as that.

what your eth buys, besides my questionable life choices:

**0.5 eth**

* at 0.5 eth, the trip happens. it's bare-bones, instant ramen and an hour's commute each way, but i'll make it work and send live updates every day.

**0.75 eth**

* at 0.75 eth, i'm not out of pocket for travel. from here on, 10% goes straight to the evmavericks' media fund. you get your story, i get to eat something green.

**1 eth**

* at 1 eth, i can afford to stay closer to the venue and upgrade from ramen to bibimbap. more time for updates, more time for mischief. you get the main conference piece plus two deep dives into standout talks.

**1.5 eth**

* at 1.5 eth, the trip and my time are fully funded. october belongs to you: i'll write weekly dispatches like i did for ethprague, covering all of the highlights. (the final piece in that series, [i went to prague so you don't have to](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/i-went-to-ethprague/), had 27,000 views).

1.5 eth is my goal. that fully funds my travel expenses and my time *and* supports the evmavericks media fund. it gives me october to write about korea blockchain week without cutting corners and without scrambling for the next freelance gig while the story is still unfolding.

**beyond 1.5 eth**

* if contributions *exceed* 1.5 eth, the extra will extend the story where possible, probably doing something completely ill-advised in the name of narrative tension. if i end up in a raccoon café interviewing minor altcoin kings for the doots podcast, you’ll know why.

all costs will be documented. anything not spent on this specific project will go to the evmavericks to fund the next great story.

support tiers (optional, dm me to claim):

* 0.01 eth: my undying gratitude. not redeemable for cash or favours.
* 0.1 eth: your name in the credits, minted on-chain. immortality crypto-style.
* 0.5 eth: send me one question for trump jr. or hoskinson. if i can find a source of cheap rice wine, maybe i'll even ask it.
* 1 eth: a personal handwritten letter about the event, full of spoilers, sent from seoul (electronically if preferred).
* 1.5 eth: you now own me. for october, anyway.

then fast forward to today, randomly i decide to check on the app with eth going up and saw my balance is now showing 0. the source of the issue is that coinbase generates an address for transactions but the recipient address generated by coinbase earlier is now for some reasons no longer tied to my account, and i can see on eth scanner that the same amount of eth is sitting in the same address, untouched.

i then contacted coinbase support, and was given some **very fishy** response: (**case #24184256**):

* first i was told that the reason why i am not seeing it is because of delay, as the ""transaction needs enough confirmation on the blockchain to be completed"". i responded that (1) there is no way an eth transfer takes more than 40 days to complete, (2) i already saw the balance in my coinbase app before and (3) the transaction status is marked completed 39 days ago
* after i pushed back, the agent responded by saying actually unfortunately the address is not tied to my account, i responded that this address is generated in coinbase app and i clearly saw the balance before.
* then after 10 minutes, she said she “checked with the team” and the address is actually still associated with my account, and it’s just not visible for some reasons. i should just “please trust them i will receive the fund and i should just wait” (after 40 days?)
* i pushed back by saying i need an explanation as to why funds can just disappear from my account and addresses can just disconnect randomly, and an eta on when this will be restored, i was then never given a response. another agent then jumped in, i repeated the explanation but as she was investigating why this address got disconnected with my account, she promised she’s getting an update, but suddenly force closed my case after 20 mins.

it is also worth noting that, as i start to push back on the first agent, on help.coinbase.com/en page whenever the agent is active i kept getting forced logged out - every time a message pops up that requires me to respond, my response will be failed to sent and upon refresh it would show that i am logged out for some reasons. and while i was gone, the agent would ask many times whether i am still connected, as if she would like to see me disconnected to be able to close the case; when this was transitioned to a new agent, the issue disappeared.

since my case was force closed, i started another case #24185822, and was essentially given the same merry-go-around, oddly, the agent also disconnected while promising me she's looking into why this address got unlinked. and the subsequent agent was also not able to help. 

due to how dodgy and inaccurate the responses were, i have two hypothesis:

* **customer support limitation** - the agents are either actually ai, or given too little access to tools, or under too much kpi pressure to provide actual help; i went through a total of 4 agents back to back, all of them would ask me the same type of basic questions or questions i've already answered. they were clearly outsourced and working on multiple cases at any given time. 
* **potential coinbase data breach / incident** - the account was generated by coinbase, they still have fund custody in this address, there was no transaction at all on any associated accounts. if i were to guess this all points to either internal system failure - either a database system migration gone wrong or some security incident that caused them to lose address-to-account mapping for some customers, potentially tied to the whole migration associated with their wallet / base app. 

**bottom line is this, before today, i did not even expect to face this type of issue with a publicly traded company i used to trust.** i was never expecting to tippy toeing on a ""legit"" platform like coinbase, if things like this can just randomly happen without clear resolution and explanation, then their mission “we are deeply focused on solving our customers’ problems with technology” sounds very much like a joke and it’s hard to separate them from any other smaller more suspicious exchanges. 

i have screenshots of all these conversations because it felt sus. now i am out of options besides escalating this with their execs or government agencies, it absolutely sucks but i am just glad i didn't put my life savings or a larger investment on this platform, because now i sure as hell don't have the trust to do that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1moo3jw/serious_disappeared_fund_due_to_coinbase_security/,0,6,1moo3jw,reddit,0.171,4579.092108876254

2025-08-13 03:03:19,"the science of manipulation: how behavioral economics challenges rationality for centuries, classical economic theory assumed that humans act rationally, always seeking to maximize personal benefit. yet an entire branch of science disputes this assumption, showing that people often act irrationally, influenced by emotions, biases, and cognitive limitations.

in this article, i explore how behavioral economics reshaped our understanding of human decision-making, why it became so influential, and what challenges it faces.

# from classical theory to psychology

classical economics was built on the idea of the “rational economic man” - a decision-maker who weighs every choice and carefully calculates benefits. according to this model, the value of a good decreases with quantity: the first unit is highly desirable, the second less so, and subsequent ones have little value.

but reality told a different story. people’s choices often depend on seemingly unrelated factors: emotions, social pressure, or mental shortcuts. behavioral economics emerged to explain these deviations.

the psychological roots trace back to adam smith’s theory of moral sentiments (1759), and in the 20th century, cognitive psychology revealed that irrationality is often systematic and predictable. behavioral economics became a bridge between individual psychology and economic processes, offering fresh insights into markets, investments, and public policy.

# key thinkers and theories

* herbert simon introduced the concept of bounded rationality - the idea that people rarely have all the information or mental resources for perfect decisions, relying instead on simplified rules of thumb.
* daniel kahneman & amos tversky revolutionized the field with prospect theory (1979). they showed that people weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains, overestimate small probabilities, and underestimate large ones. how information is framed (“90% success rate” vs. “10% risk”) can drastically change choices.
* richard thaler, a major popularizer of the field, developed the idea of nudging - subtle changes in choice architecture that guide people toward better outcomes without removing freedom of choice. examples include automatic pension enrollment or placing healthy foods at eye level.
* robert shiller applied behavioral principles to finance, showing how emotions like optimism and panic fuel market bubbles and crashes. his concept of narrative economics highlights how stories shape investor behavior.

# why we make irrational choices

behavioral economics identifies several systematic reasons for irrational decision-making:

* bounded rationality: limited information, time, and mental capacity lead to reliance on heuristics - quick, intuitive rules that can cause errors.
* emotions & social influence: feelings, social norms, and peer pressure affect our choices, often more than logic.
* market inefficiency: investor biases and herd behavior create pricing anomalies, challenging the efficient market hypothesis.

# common cognitive traps

* anchoring: relying too heavily on the first piece of information.
* reflection effect: risk-averse in gains, risk-seeking in losses.
* status quo bias: preferring current conditions over change.
* endowment effect: overvaluing possessions simply because they are ours.
* framing effect: choices change depending on wording.
* availability heuristic: judging likelihood based on memorable examples.
* representativeness heuristic: ignoring statistics in favor of stereotypes.
* gambler’s fallacy: believing past random events affect future ones.

# nudging or manipulation? the ethical debate

not everyone welcomes behavioral economics. critics like milton friedman and eugene fama argue that, in competitive markets with access to information, people generally approach rational behavior. they question whether experimental results apply to complex real-world markets.

others, like psychologist nick chater, warn that nudging can border on manipulation - especially if people aren’t aware they’re being influenced. this raises ethical questions about balancing free will with guided decision-making.

# the future of behavioral economics

today, behavioral economics blends with neuroscience, big data, and artificial intelligence to create real-time models of decision-making. governments form dedicated “nudge units” (e.g., the uk’s behavioral insights team) to tackle social issues, from tax compliance to environmental responsibility. marketing and finance increasingly apply behavioral tools to influence consumer choices and investor behavior.

ultimately, behavioral economics views humans not as perfectly rational machines, but as complex beings shaped by psychology, emotions, and social context. it explains why we deviate from rationality - and how those deviations can be understood, predicted, and even steered.

2025-08-13 03:46:29,"i’m purposely storing a seed phrase as a screen shot and email as an extra safety precaution. hear me out- i’m not **completely** stupid. there is a method to my madness….

**so first of all i have my coins on a trezor with the seed phrase written down and secured separately to the device itself. there are no digital records of it on my phone or emails or anywhere else for that matter**

but what i have decided to do: i put a small amount <$50 in a soft wallet and i’m keeping the screen shot of the seed phrase in my email and phone gallery. i’m looking at this as cheap indicator my phone / email is compromised. it’s a tiny sum of money i’m fully prepared to lose. if i log in some day and notice my soft wallet has been taken and my $50 missing, then i know my phone and email is now compromised and no longer safe to use with my main holdings. it also works as a “decoy” wallet. on the off chance something extreme happened and i got physically robbed i could just open that wallet and say *”here, this is all that’s there”*. 

any flaws with this logic or is it just unnecessary ott security? or is it a good idea that people would consider doing? i’m also interested in hearing other people’s creative ideas (not the obvious don’t keep your seed phrase on your phone etc)

2025-08-13 12:26:29,"without chainlink, crypto collapses – why link might be the most important asset in the entire space most people see chainlink (link) as “just an oracle project.” in my opinion, that’s like calling the internet “just some computers connected together.” technically true, but missing the entire point.

i believe chainlink is the invisible infrastructure that keeps the entire crypto universe running – and without it, things would grind to a halt faster than most realize.

**1. blockchains are blind without reliable external data**  
blockchains are fantastic at executing code. they can enforce agreements with mathematical certainty… but only with the data they already have. they can’t natively know the price of eth in usd, whether it’s raining in new york, or if a stock market closed higher today.

chainlink solves this with secure, decentralized data feeds. that’s not just a convenience – it’s critical. without trustworthy data, smart contracts would be stuck in a vacuum.

**2. billions of dollars already depend on chainlink every day**  
look at defi. platforms like aave, synthetix, gmx, and countless others rely on chainlink’s price feeds to determine collateral values, execute trades, or trigger liquidations.

if one data feed failed or was manipulated, it could cause cascading failures worth billions. link’s oracle network is one of the main reasons that hasn’t happened.

**3. it’s not just defi – it’s everything**  
chainlink is moving beyond finance. it provides weather data for blockchain-based insurance. it enables real-world asset tokenization by linking traditional markets to blockchains.

and with ccip (cross-chain interoperability protocol), it’s bridging entire blockchains together. imagine bitcoin and ethereum talking to each other seamlessly, or a private bank network interacting with public chains – that’s what ccip is aiming to deliver.

**4. the partnerships are on another level**  
google, swift, aws, dtcc, anz bank… the list goes on. these aren’t speculative “maybe one day” partnerships – they’re actual integrations, pilots, and testnets. chainlink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and web3.

**5. it’s the “plumbing” of crypto – and plumbing isn’t sexy**  
the average person doesn’t think about dns when they type a website address. they just expect it to work. in the same way, most people in crypto don’t think about where their price data comes from – but without chainlink, their favorite defi app wouldn’t function.

that’s why link often flies under the radar: it’s critical, but invisible.

**so… is link the most important crypto asset?**  
i think bitcoin is irreplaceable as a store of value. ethereum is unmatched as a general-purpose platform. but without chainlink, both lose a significant part of their functionality.

for me, link is like electricity. not as flashy as the devices it powers, but without it, nothing else works.

2025-08-13 12:27:46,"what is value and price, and why bitcoin’s price will keep rising we all know the words “value” and “price”, but what do they really mean, and what’s the difference between them? why are some things worth millions while others are worth nothing at all? what role do society, resources, time, and even culture play in shaping these concepts?

let’s start with definitions:

**value** – a subjective perception of the importance, usefulness, or significance of something. it’s the “why” behind why something matters or doesn’t.

**price** – a quantitative expression of value (usually in money), showing exactly how much something costs in numerical terms.

for example: the item with the highest value to a human – water – has a low price in most regions, while a useless memecoin has no real value at all but may sometimes carry a high price.

# types of price

price is a tool for measurement and exchange.

**exchange value** – the foundation of a market economy, showing how much other goods or money one can get for an item.  
example: 1 btc = 110,000 usd or 1 btc = 1,617 barrels of oil. in a market economy, exchange value is driven by market price, determined by supply and demand.

**imputed value** – the estimated value of a good or service based on expert calculation, analogy, or assumed usefulness rather than market mechanisms. used in government policy, ecosystem service evaluation, social policy, tender bids, and in valuing public goods where market-based pricing is impossible.

**cost price** – the sum of all actual expenses incurred to produce and deliver a product or service to the consumer. it includes raw materials, labor, equipment depreciation, rent, energy, taxes, and other costs. it defines the minimum price at which a product can be sold without incurring a loss.

**intrinsic value (fair value)** – a theoretically justified valuation of an asset, company, or project based on fundamentals: profits, cash flows, assets and liabilities, growth prospects, and market risks.  
example: an investor calculates that a company’s stock is worth $100, but it trades at $70. he concludes it’s an undervalued asset and buys.

# types of value

value is multidimensional and can be classified both by its source and by how it’s perceived.

**utilitarian value** – usefulness, ranging from life-essential (water, food, oxygen) to nearly useless (souvenirs) and even negative utility (harmful items like cigarettes). the price of highly useful goods depends on time and place. for example, a bottle of water is cheap almost everywhere, but in a desert emergency its price can skyrocket.

**emotional value** – tied to personal feelings or memories, such as a childhood toy or a gift from a loved one. for most people, such an item is worthless, but for one person, it can be priceless.

**cultural value** – connected to history, art, and tradition. this includes antiques, vintage items, and objects that represent important symbols (religious, national, etc.).

**social value** – what’s important in the eyes of others. these are status-signaling items like luxury watches, expensive cars, or limited-edition sneakers. often, the brand and scarcity are the main drivers of price.

**existential value** – things that cannot be expressed in monetary terms: freedom, life, love, worldview.

# factors affecting price

here are 15 key factors that shape the final price:

1. production costs (cost price)
2. rarity
3. supply and demand (plus liquidity)
4. competition
5. government regulation
6. logistics
7. technological level
8. brand and image
9. marketing and packaging
10. consumer psychology
11. traditions and culture
12. currency exchange rates
13. inflation
14. financial bubbles
15. geopolitics and crises

# why bitcoin’s price will rise

bitcoin is a completely new asset class. it’s not a commodity, stock, or bond, so traditional valuation methods like intrinsic value or fair value don’t apply.

what it does have: cost of production, average market price, trading volumes, and liquidity.

bitcoin through the 15 price factors:

1. cost price – driven by mining costs, mainly electricity and taxes. halving increases cost price over time.
2. rarity – supply limited to 21 million btc; decreasing over time due to lost keys.
3. supply and demand – 560m crypto holders, $10–20b spot volume, $40–60b with futures & etfs. etfs expand access.
4. competition – altcoins are not real competitors; the only rival is gold.
5. government regulation – u.s. acceptance is a global green light; states and companies now hold btc.
6. logistics – irrelevant except for transaction fees.
7. technology – debated, but simple, reliable, decentralized.
8. brand – bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency.
9. marketing – best ad is rising price.
10. consumer psychology – veblen effect boosts demand.
11. traditions & culture – btc is culturally neutral.
12. currencies – correlated with usd.
13. inflation – makes btc attractive, especially in high-inflation countries.
14. bubbles – bitcoin thrives in speculative growth cycles.
15. geopolitics – potential to behave like gold in crises.

# conclusion

bitcoin is almost the perfect asset for price growth, as it checks nearly all key factors driving value higher. the only serious threats are mining pool collusion (51% attack) and quantum computing, both unlikely in the near term. other risks may cause short-term drops but aren’t existential.

what makes it different:

* privacy by default: no accounts, no cookies, no analytics. your portfolio never leaves your device.
* offline-first: it works without internet (pwa). prices and balances refresh when you’re online, but the app opens and functions offline.
* add from wallets or manually:
   * wallet import supported for ton, ethereum, solana, bitcoin, tron.
   * everything else can be added manually (quick add flow).
* mobile-friendly ux.

how it works (quick flow)

* add assets manually or import from a wallet.
* set purchase price and notes/tags.
* the app fetches prices (when online) and calculates p\&l; everything stays local.

why privacy matters here

* portfolio data is sensitive. we don’t want your balances, tags, or notes on any server.
* no sign-ins, no third-party tracking, no “we’ll improve it later” — it’s designed to be private from day one.

1. oil prices are at a 2-year low, yet inflation is still hanging around.

3. tariffs are back, but it’s unclear if they’ve hit yet or maybe the impact is already buried in the data?

also, if oil is this low and inflation is still sticky… what happens if oil goes up even a little? wouldn’t that push inflation way higher again?

2025-08-13 16:27:36,"my co-workers are using the term ""altcoins"" at lunch yes, i'm tagging this as anecdotal.

i've been in crypto since the 2020 crash and subsequent market boom in 2021. last time around, as crypto was heating up, there was a noted rise in public comment: an nfl player requesting his salary in bitcoin instead of dollars, bitcoin purchase stations being added to us gas stations, and even that goddamn superbowl commercial.

it was a time for trotting out a longtime crypto concept: everyone feels like a genius in the boom times.

once bitcoin got mentioned on my dad's local news station, even he started talking about it, and how his (elderly) neighbors were all aware that it was a crazy scam.

the real sign of the times, though, was when my co-workers decided to start talking about bitcoin and their ""altcoin portfolios"" at lunch. mind you: these are people who don't own stocks, laughed at me when i told them i used our company's 401-k matching offer, and let multiple people know that their ultimate retirement plan is to win a couple of big scratch-off lottery tickets. (you know, because if they buy a few every week for life, they're ""guaranteed"" to win a big one or two.)

then the bubble burst and my co-workers all shut the hell up about crypto except for one who admitted their paper hands folding. (i suspect all of them traded at a loss instead of waiting 5 years for this run-up.)

anyway, the circle is becoming complete again: my co-worker lunch table is talking loudly about doge and other altcoins and how they're going to get vacation homes soon.

you know the rest, cryptofam: if you've been dcaing since the 2021 crash, we're back into the public talking phase. will the bigger fireworks go off? bitcoin hitting 122k was a big damn firework, for sure, but will we see something more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mp957l/my_coworkers_are_using_the_term_altcoins_at_lunch/,65,34,1mp957l,reddit,-0.7615,4674.336708526263

24-hour change is +9.75%

market cap is $567.7 billion

trading volume is $67.7 billion

circulating supply is 120.7 million ether

there are many key factors driving the price action such as institutional purchases of ethereum as retail is starting to sell.

ethereum etfs have seen more than $2.3 billion in inflows the last week, which is much more aggressive than bitcoin etfs in that time period!

network activity is booming currently with nearly 1.87 million transactions daily and increased nft activity on the blockchain.

total value locked (tvl) is $95 billion with eth having more than 61% of the share!

but most importantly, i feel the upgrades have had an immense impact in the price action such as eip-1559 that improved the efficiency of the network and brought in fee burning to decrease the inflationary pressures we saw.

finbold models target ethereum price range of $5,607 \~ $5,250 by august 31^(st)!

macd – 5 green bars in a row, bullish crossing

rsi >70 – overbought and trending up

volume – new record for ethereum etf inflows ($1.5 billion within 2 days)

2025-08-14 03:37:54,"altseason incoming? here’s why i think it’s closer than you think we’ve all been waiting for it… the legendary altseason. and i think we’re very close. here’s why:

macd & rsi at rock bottom. on the weekly timeframe, both indicators are sitting in some of the lowest zones we’ve seen in ages. historically, that’s been a strong reversal signal.

stablecoin legislation in the us. new laws and regulatory clarity could push issuers to mint more stablecoins. more stables = more liquidity flowing into the market.

trump’s pension fund bill. allows us retirement funds to allocate to crypto. that’s a whole new class of institutional money.

etf momentum beyond btc & eth. we’re seeing a wave of altcoin etf filings, and big firms are starting to position themselves around alts, not just bitcoin.

google search spikes. “altcoin” and “ethereum” searches are at multi-year highs. retail attention is heating up.

cycle pattern. btc pumps first, then eth, then the alts. we’re right in that middle stage now.



so… the question is:

what other arguments do you have for an imminent altseason?

and what are the strongest points against it happening soon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mppnzz/altseason_incoming_heres_why_i_think_its_closer/,0,7,1mppnzz,reddit,0.6298,4754.3232084568335
2025-08-14 04:04:55,"bitcoin hits new ath with 124k, how high are we looking at in 2025? so we're past the $124k mark and honestly, the numbers i'm seeing for where bitcoin could end up by december are pretty wild. been digging through everything, from big institutions to crypto analysts to trading algorithms, and figured i'd share what the consensus looks like.

majority of analysts are believeing in somewhat range of 130k-145k range. this is kind of a safe instituitional forecast, but with bitcoin we have seen how wrong the analysts predictions can be in actually good sense.\\

mid-range optimists are throwing around $150k-$170k targets. investing haven's stretched targets go up to $174k-$181k.  the moonshot predictions are getting crazy though. peter brandt is calling $200k. anthony scaramucci thinks $170k is doable.

what's driving this? the institutional money keeps pouring in—blackrock's eth etf alone hit $10 billion. we've got the strategic bitcoin reserve thing happening in washington. the regulatory clarity act is moving through congress. supply shock from the halving. corporate treasuries adding btc.

somewhere between $130k-$160k feels realistic if current momentum holds. the $200k+ calls need everything to go perfect, but honestly? after watching bitcoin hit $124k when most people thought $100k was ambitious, maybe ""impossible"" targets aren't so impossible anymore.

for context:  
 → it peaked close to $4,000+ during the 2017 bull.  
 → it's still supported on most major platforms.  
 → it *works* as peer-to-peer digital cash.  
 → devs are still building and there's legit community support (albeit quieter than btc or eth).  
  
i’m not expecting an overnight moonshot, but i wouldn’t be surprised if we slowly grind back toward pre-fork levels in a full-blown bull say $3k–$5k over the next 12–18 months. especially with btc dominance pulling back, capital rotation into older alts is inevitable.  
  
to position for that, i’ve been slowly adding to my bch stack and continue to do so. neхo actually has a promo right now where you get 3% back if you increase your bch balance and hold it just a nice bonus while i accumulate through august. if you’re already bullish, it kind of makes sense.

2025-08-14 15:53:47,"[ama] we are liquity v2 and home to bold - the ethereum dollar. hey everyone!

liquity v2 here - we launched on mainnet in may 19, and have quickly racked up $190m in tvl and $43m in bold supply.

we are an immutable cdp on mainnet (think makerdao), where you can deposit eth, wsteth, and reth at an interest rate of your choosing, to mint $bold.

you might know us from liquity v1 and lusd, the og venue where you could deposit eth, and mint lusd at a fixed 0.5% borrow cost.

with v2, we feel we've created the ultimate borrowing and earning venue for decentralization purists.

**tl;dr**

* set your own interest rate when borrowing with eth, wsteth, and reth
* you can mint $bold: a stablecoin that is backed by the assets above only, over-collateralized,  with redemptions available at all times.
* 100% yield is passed on to $bold holders, resulting in a stablecoin that generates organic, sustainable yield.
* the protocol is completely immutable and permissionless.
* v2 will have 15 + forks across various l2s and evms, all who will be allocating roughly \~4% of their token supply to bold holders, resulting in exciting yield opportunities (link below).

**what’s new in liquity v2**

* borrow & leverage with eth / wsteth / reth
* set your own interest rates for maximum capital efficency
* real, sustainable yield for bold, along with 15+ venues to use it across defi.
* protocol-incentivized liquidity for lps
* airdrop opportunities with 15+ friendly forks (each allocating \~3-4% of their tokens)
* yield bearing versions of bold in ysybold and sbold that you can use across defi.

**values**

* immutable contracts, no counterparty risk
* no core protocol governance (terms and conditions remain the same)
* eth/lst-only collateral (eth, wsteth, reth)

right now, we’re seeing a familiar pattern: btc and eth surged, and now prices are starting to dip again. it’s the same story every cycle. new people jump in during the hype, the price goes up even more, and then reality sets in. those who over-invested or put in more than they can afford to lose become nervous, scared and highly reactive to negative change. a small drop in price occurs, and suddenly, the emotional chain reaction of sell-offs begins. huge drop in price incoming.

when this happens, just take a breath.

this kind of volatility is normal. what you’re seeing is weak hands getting shaken out. it’s not the end. it never is.

the best advice i can give: **zoom out**. look at the big picture. over any 2–3 year period in crypto history, if you held strong and didn’t try to trade every wave, you were likely rewarded. crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. it’s a long game.

so if you believe in the fundamentals of what you're investing in, **stay the course**. don’t let short-term noise wreck long-term gains.

2025-08-14 18:31:30,"ama: pudgy penguins and building the internet's mickey mouse hey reddit!

i’m luca netz, the ceo of pudgy penguins, and i’m super excited to be doing this ama with the [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/) community, and to start showing up on reddit in a big way.

for those who don’t know pudgy penguins, let me give you the backstory. in 2021, pudgy penguins exploded in the nft scene as one of the first great nft projects. within months, pudgy penguins was on the front page of the new york times, the first and only nft project to earn that spot.

however, shortly after its meteoric rise, the project lost momentum. internal issues, a cooling market, and shaken trust led to it being written off by much of the crypto audience. outside of a small group of loyal holders, most people thought pudgy penguins was dead.

that’s when the community stepped in. myself and a group of other pudgy penguin holders made a public offer to buy the project for 750 eth (about $2.5m at the time) with the goal of turning the project around to its former glory.

our strategy for accomplishing this vision was simple and was predicated around something we call the “penguin proliferation thesis.” this thesis puts marketing and character awareness above all. the idea is: if the penguin is everywhere the ip will do the heavy lifting in invading the hearts and minds of every day people. as the penguin continues to proliferate the finite supply of the nfts and token will appreciate, creating a self fulfilling prophecy and flywheel for success for all ecosystem participants.

our big break came when we launched pudgy toys in 3,000 walmarts via a pallet program in october of 2023. this activation wasn’t an ordinary activation, it was the biggest activation walmart can give any consumer brand and we got it as our first big retail push during the hottest time of the year (q4). the toys also weren’t ordinary, it was the first time physical products were created and licensed directly from holders of the pudgy penguins nfts. on its face it was menial, but if you look under the hood you realize that it shifted the paradigm of consumer brands forever. the idea that you can be a first edition collector of a brand, and then have access to earn royalties from that collectible, adds a layer of participation to the brand funnel that never existed before. outside of each toy being licensed from the community, every pudgy toy included a qr code unlocking free nfts to pudgy world, a digital experience where anyone can create and collect nft traits in an open world style experience. today, the toys are now in over 10,000 retailers worldwide, including walmart, target, walgreens, and gamestop. since then, pudgy penguins has taken the penguin proliferation thesis outside of toys and collectibles, into entertainment, social content, finance, consumables, and more.

after years of success, it was clear that the barrier to entry into the pudgy penguins ecosystem was too high (our nfts were $50,000 a piece), and it was clear that if we truly wanted to be the face of crypto, we needed an asset in our ecosystem that was accessible. that is when we decided to launch $pengu, the official social currency and token (more on social currencies in my article here: [https://lucanetz.substack.com/p/social-currencies-are-the-future](https://lucanetz.substack.com/p/social-currencies-are-the-future)) of pudgy penguins.

$pengu now has over 850,000 holders on dexs alone. our airdrop distributed $1.4b worth of tokens to over 6 million people, the eighth largest in crypto history and the largest airdrop ever on solana. the story of pudgy penguins is one that is for the people, by the people and it was important the origin story of this token was a moment for everyone.

$pengu is now listed on over 120 exchanges, including coinbase, robinhood, revoult, and upbit. this shifted pudgy penguins from a brand-and-consumer model to a brand-and-participant model.

2025-08-15 01:20:29,"why do people think their blockchains are fully on chain? **look into the blockchain you invest in.**  
do not just take the marketing material or a social media post at face value. take the time to understand how it works, where it runs, and who controls it. many people assume that because something is called a blockchain it is automatically fully on chain, but that is rarely the case. aside from value focused blockchains like bitcoin, and execution focused blockchains such as ethereum, the only major platform that runs everything including compute, storage, governance, and execution fully on chain is the internet computer protocol. most others are hybrids at best or partially centralized ledgers presented as blockchains.

when we talk about a blockchain being on chain we are talking about more than just recording transactions in a public ledger. it means the application logic, state changes, and data storage actually live on the blockchain itself where they are verifiable, tamperproof, and run without reliance on third party servers. in a true on chain model, everything from the code to the data is hosted and executed by the decentralized network. remove a node or even multiple nodes and the system continues running because no part of it depends on a single party’s infrastructure.

most blockchains do not operate this way. they run a consensus layer on chain to record transactions, but push the heavy lifting off chain. smart contracts often store pointers to data rather than the data itself. applications usually run their frontends and backends on centralized services like aws, google cloud, or other traditional hosting. even in networks with many validators, the core application stack can still be dependent on centralized infrastructure for hosting, computation, or indexing. if that off chain infrastructure goes down, the application breaks even if the ledger is still technically online.

this hybrid setup creates several problems. it weakens the tamperproof claim because if your backend logic or user interface is controlled by a single company it can be altered or shut down without consensus from the network. it increases the attack surface because hacks and exploits often occur when the off chain backend or bridge is compromised. these incidents are not blockchain ledger breaches but failures caused by centralized components that sit outside the chain.

we see this pattern repeatedly. the headlines about millions of dollars stolen from a protocol often trace back to a compromised front end, a faulty library, or an insecure key. the blockchain ledger itself remains untouched, but because the application logic lives off chain, an attacker can reroute funds or trick users into approving malicious transactions. these incidents happen because the system was never truly self contained on chain to begin with.

icp was built to avoid this problem entirely. its architecture allows developers to deploy canisters, which are smart contracts that can contain both code and data, directly to the blockchain. the frontend, backend, and database can all be hosted on chain and served directly from the network to the user’s browser without intermediaries. this removes the need for aws buckets, centralized backends, or hidden infrastructure dependencies. the code running your application is exactly what you can verify on the blockchain.

ethereum offers an open execution environment where smart contracts live on chain and run without central servers. however, because ethereum is expensive and slower for high volume storage and complex computation, many applications built on ethereum rely on off chain infrastructure for parts of their stack. this is a practical trade off, but it blurs the line between being on chain and being merely anchored to a blockchain.

value based blockchains like bitcoin operate differently. they focus entirely on securing the transfer of value and maintaining a censorship resistant ledger. they do not claim to run applications or host data on chain, so they avoid the mismatch between expectation and reality. their simplicity contributes to their security.

for other blockchains, the marketing often paints a picture of a fully decentralized self contained system when that is not the truth. the moment you realize that the application you use depends on a centralized backend you should also realize that the guarantees of decentralization and tamperproof operation no longer fully apply. this is why so many exploits are possible. attackers target the weak links, and in most so called blockchains, those weak links are off chain.

if you are investing in a project, understand the difference between a ledger on chain and a full application on chain. ledger only platforms can be fine for certain use cases, but they will never provide the same guarantees as a network where the entire stack, from smart contract logic to user facing code, is decentralized. icp proves that it is possible. the question is whether the others even want to try, because moving to a fully on chain architecture would require fundamentally rethinking their business models and governance structures.

until then, the next time someone claims their favorite blockchain is fully on chain, ask them where the application logic runs, where the data lives, and what happens if their chosen cloud provider shuts down for a week. if they cannot answer without naming a centralized service, you will know exactly how on chain it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mqji9q/why_do_people_think_their_blockchains_are_fully/,19,93,1mqji9q,reddit,0.0971,4574.87627387969

bitcoin:

\-support: 117k (yes, that’s a big support level)

\-hourly chart could morph into a bear flag, so bulls need to watch their back.

\-a note from our analyst: “falls like yesterday trigger a buy reaction — the more violent the drop, the less risk attached to it.”

ethereum:

\-previous ath from 2021? 4,850.

\-current congestion zone 4,550–4,750 likely absorbed most selling pressure.

\-plan: buy a breakout above 4,800 (with a tight stop). weak shorts there could be forced to cover in panic.

big picture:

btc is flirting with a short-term floor while eth is coiling right under a major breakout level. if eth clears 4,800, there’s little in the way until blue sky territory — and if btc clears 120k with conviction, we might see a rush of sidelined money pile in.

why those picks specifically (e.g., utility, team, community, metrics like daas, profitability)?
also, keeping in mind the classic rotation thesis (money flows down the risk curve: btc first, then eth and large caps (we are seeing this already in full force), mids, and finally small caps/memes/degen plays), what would you buy now to position yourself for this and/or what would you rotate into over the next few months when alts start pumping?

this execution-layer proposal adds three key technical elements directly into the body of ethereum blocks and is designed to give the network a serious performance boost:

• block access list (bal): a full record of all addresses and storage slots touched by the block’s transactions.

• transaction indices: pinpointing the exact position of each transaction within the block.

• post-execution values: the final changes each transaction makes to ethereum’s global state.

**how glamsterdam is coming together:**   
last week, developers at the all core devs – consensus (acdc) #162 confirmed eip-7732 (enshrined proposer-builder separation) as the first headliner.

now, with bals on board, glamsterdam is shaping up to be one of ethereum’s most exciting upgrades yet.

**what will be next?**

• focil (eip-7805) is still under consideration and could become the third headliner, as discussed on the all core developers execution (acde) call #218.

• six-second slots (eip-7782), however, have been rejected for this fork.

they approved all the tokens accrued as fees to their router, getting drained immediately by mev bots.

this same swapper is known to have had issues with zora claims on base, since it allows users to have it make arbitrary calls

this just goes to show that even the most experienced people and companies have to be careful when interacting on-chain, specially due to mev bots.

2025-08-15 22:22:52,"what is the most secure mobile wallet? hey fam, i'm very security focused. not only trezor / ledger, 2fas, security keys etc, but i also use passphrases for all my wallets. i do use hot wallets only with small amounts.

now, i will need ot be on the road, and have larger amounts for when the time is right. my question is: what wallet does offer for me to enter passphrase on demand, similar to trezor and ledger?

i moved out majorly to trezor now, but both of these allow for entering a passphrase with each login, which i love and use.

is there something similar for mobile? relying on trezor / ledger would not work in my case, i need strictly a mobile wallet that allows this, or any further security authorization besides simple pin-entry.

2025-08-16 01:20:17,"why corporate bitcoin hoarding could trigger the next big crypto selloff by july 2025 public companies were sitting on 917,853 btc and one of them, saylor’s strategy, holds 607,700 of that, it about 2.9% of all bitcoin. a year ago the total corporate stash was just 325,400 btc, so the growth has been insane. 

a lot of these new players aren’t just diversifying like tesla or coinbase. some are miners holding instead of selling, but a growing chunk are basically quasi-etfs whose whole business is piling up btc per share and even branching into eth or sol. 

they raise money with convertible bonds, which means if things go south they might have to dump coins to cover debt. that’s where the domino risk comes in. even if the first big debt maturities aren’t until 2029, a single panic sell could shake confidence and spark a chain reaction long before then. 

the irony is bitcoin was born after the 2008 crash to get away from wall street’s risky games, and now those same mechanics could end up being the weak spot in the market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mrgmow/why_corporate_bitcoin_hoarding_could_trigger_the/,210,85,1mrgmow,reddit,-0.9474,4474.621447041862
2025-08-16 02:47:26,"ether machine overview ethereum just had its microstrategy moment.

the newly announced ""ether machine"", set to trade on nasdaq under the ticker ethm, is launching with a treasury of over 400,000 eth (~$1.6 billion), making it one of the largest publicly traded ethereum holdings ever.

but unlike traditional passive crypto vehicles, ether machine isn't just sitting on its eth stash — it's actively putting eth to work through staking, restaking, and participating strategically in defi protocols. think microstrategy, but generating yields rather than just hodling.

why does this matter?

institutions have been cautiously circling ethereum, waiting for a clear, regulated, professionally managed entry point. ether machine provides exactly that: institutional-grade exposure to ethereum’s native yield mechanisms, transparently wrapped inside a nasdaq-listed structure. it's a validation of eth not just as a speculative asset but as productive, yield-generating capital.

what makes it different?

* active yield generation: instead of passive holding, the ether machine actively stakes and restakes eth, compounding its holdings and strengthening ethereum’s economic security.
* transparent and compliant: a publicly listed structure ensures transparency, regulatory clarity, and accountability, making it attractive to institutional investors previously sidelined by compliance concerns.
* infrastructure builder: beyond yields, ether machine builds ethereum-native infrastructure, supporting validators, enterprises, and decentralized organizations.

this is institutional finance finally getting serious about ethereum as a productive, income-generating asset. backed by major crypto investors (including pantera capital, committing $1.5 billion), ether machine marks a tipping point in eth's mainstream legitimacy.

in other words, it's a clear sign yet of ethereum’s maturity as a foundational asset for institutional portfolios.

2025-08-16 03:26:07,"btc and eth etfs just had their biggest week ever and it's getting spicy between these two so apparently bitcoin and ethereum etfs just posted a combined $40b in volume this week. that's their strongest performance yet, and honestly the competition between these two is getting pretty interesting.

the fascinating part is how eth seems to be following btc's playbook from early 2024. remember when bitcoin etfs launched in january and everyone was skeptical, then it just kept climbing? eth etfs had the same lukewarm reception when they launched in july 2024, but now they're pulling massive numbers  $1.01b in net inflows just on monday alone.

what's really got my attention is that eth supply on exchanges just dropped to 12% while this is happening. so you've got decreasing supply, massive etf inflows, and btc setting the pace upward.
some analysts think eth's new ath is still weeks or months away, but honestly with how these etfs are performing and the way they're pushing each other higher, i'm not so sure about that timeline.
anyone else notice how these two have become weirdly symbiotic through the etf structure?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mrje3r/btc_and_eth_etfs_just_had_their_biggest_week_ever/,17,4,1mrje3r,reddit,0.5927,4448.557665954041
