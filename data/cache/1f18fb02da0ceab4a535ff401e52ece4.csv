for example, if alice sends 1 btc to bob, i want to know step by step:

* how transactions are created and signed with private/public keys
* how they‚Äôre broadcast to the network and stored in mempool
* how miners pick transactions and form a block
* how the nonce is generated and tested against the target difficulty
* who decides/assigns this target value (and how difficulty adjusts)
* how proof of work ensures consensus
* how the block is validated by other nodes and added to the chain
* how immutability is maintained (e.g., why changing one block breaks the whole chain)

2025-08-17 10:51:08+00:00,"a little comfort in the chaos tl;dr: in a world that constantly devalues your time and money, the unchanging fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin is a rare source of certainty and mathematical beauty.

life‚Äôs been fun so far throwing a few of curve balls.
divorced. no contact with my parents with them being raised in a cult and not accepting my lack of faith. lost friends because of it. i‚Äôve struggled with what i‚Äôve thought was an acceptable amount of depression and hid behind proving myself with success at work and numbing the rest with alcohol.

i‚Äôve found it challenging to have the same level of conviction with opinions as my friends seem to have which always ended in me distancing myself from them. probably from finding for myself that my faith was a sham and my marriage had no foundation. it‚Äôs difficult to trust and for good reason. there are so many things in this day and age that you have to have the correct opinion on or risk alienation and backlash. pronouns, presidents and palestine. what‚Äôs the right side? what are the facts? how do people seem so certain about things all the time? why is everyone yelling.

all this while being bent over a mortgage (if you‚Äôre lucky) being paid by money that is losing value quicker than you can earn it. after tax. depending on the interest rate flavour of the month. the growing cost of living. if only you‚Äôd just work a little harder and pull yourself up by your boot straps‚Ä¶ fuck off.

i drank to quieten the intolerable noise with my life slowly losing light even though on paper and on the outside i have it pretty good. the game is rigged against us. some struggle putting food on the table. some a roof over their head. some will work to an early grave. and others will never know what it is to even be in this rat race. few are the latter and i‚Äôd challenge that they‚Äôre not here. there‚Äôs a club and you‚Äôre not in it.

i bought some sats a few years ago in early covid as i had learnt a bit and although there was risk i was convinced it would go up in the long run as the data showed. it was also to force me to pay attention to it. it didn‚Äôt go up. i felt stupid but held. i read more and watched a lot. i was told i was stupid from friends - again with the opinions. i think i coined the phrase ‚Äúyou have to be in it to lose it‚Äù.

i forgot about it until last year when the money printer made it go up. stay humble. thankfully i kept it to myself. i decided to buy a lot more. researched cold wallets. safe storage. practiced my backups. it‚Äôs all locked away.

for me things changed here. it was no longer an investment. it was something pure and it was mine. i‚Äôd owned physical gold and silver but holding this is different.

unlike anything else in this universe - this is beautifully finite. there are only ever going to be 21 million. and nothing can change that. that‚Äôs one thing i know. and for me it‚Äôs attached to the most important thing which is the transfer and storage of the value of my time. faith, politics can have a question mark but this is fact.

i do know that there are 21m. and i know that myself and others now value that. that this can‚Äôt be manipulated. and that‚Äôs its value. that in a world where we are getting fucked sideways you can‚Äôt fuck with that. and every day its growth stabilises with more aligning to this value. it‚Äôs backed by us choosing to opt out of the crazy setup we were spawned into. 1b = 1b and 1sat = 1sat

i don‚Äôt like to be called a crypto bro. i don‚Äôt want a lambo. i find a bit of the culture a little cringy. buttcoin might not see the beauty and intent. but i‚Äôm glad to be here. in a small way, it‚Äôs helped me stop drinking, look up from my feet a bit more and brought a little light back every time i hear a story of someone getting a deposit for a house for their family or a little leg up in this mess of a world.

ben cowen is the only crypto youtuber i listen to. i‚Äôm sure there are other people who are just as genuine and rational as him, but the most crypto influencers on social media are just delusional moonboys. ben has been right many times about btc.d and ‚Äùeth going home‚Äù. so, i think his views should be respected. he doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat anything and tell you what you want to hear, but he tells you what you need to hear. 

this is a short summary of the video. he basically drew these conclusions (i‚Äôm quoting a comment because this person outlined ben‚Äôs point in a very succinct way): 

‚Äúalts stay strong and/or rally against btc for the rest of august ~2 more weeks. correction by btc/usd in september will bring eth below aths and bring alts to the range lows by late october/early november at the latest. larger alt season occurs after, some time in q4.‚Äù

what do you think? he admitted that he would be wrong but this is tje most likely outcome. i find his conclusion very plausible. as someone whose portfolio is 100% altcoins, this wasn‚Äôt what i wanted to hear, but i accept it. however, the good news is that after alts hit the range lows in october/early-november (at the latest), that could potentially be the starting point of what we‚Äôve been waiting for. so, altseason could potentially start somewhere in november‚Äìdecember.

hope this is the right place for this. 29f, in grad school, and i've finally saved up a little bit of money that i want to put to work for my future.

i've been trying to get into crypto, but honestly, it's incredibly intimidating. between the technical jargon, the memes, the constant fear of getting rugged, and the 24/7 market cycle, it feels like you need a phd just to get started. i'm a pretty smart person, but this is a whole different language.

my question is for the people who have been in this space for a while: what's your real, unfiltered advice for a beginner who wants to do more than just buy some btc and pray? what's the one thing you wish someone had told you when you were first starting out? i'm trying to learn how to think about this stuff for the long term, not just chase the next pump.

i'm trying to find the signal in all the noise, and it's a lot to figure out on your own. i'd be grateful for any genuine advice that cuts through the hype, thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1msb8lm/feeling_overwhelmed_as_a_newcomer_can_i_get_some/,28,90,1msb8lm,reddit
