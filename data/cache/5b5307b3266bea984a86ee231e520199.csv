the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin.¬†**this strategy not only strengthens profusa‚Äôs balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company‚Äôs prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa‚Äôs commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.**¬†this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa‚Äôs leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa‚Äôs bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

2025-08-14 14:58:55,"fidelity or robinhood for bitcoin iras? i currently own bitcoin in my roth ira through choice by kingdom trust, but i am wanting to transfer to either robinhood or fidelity because choice's fees are just too high to justify staying there. i'm having a difficult time choosing between the two options i've narrowed it down to:

  
fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time. 

  
i plan on mainly hodling, with possibly making 1-2 trades every few years if i feel like playing with the cycles.

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

i have a large group of friends and a big family, and i‚Äôd love to motivate them to get into bitcoin by gifting them a small amount - for example as a birthday gift, wedding gift, or for any other occasion.

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions‚Äîlike fear and greed‚Äîthat those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,6,22,1mrjzn5,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9955,117533.98734372148

2025-08-16 04:53:37,"bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‚Äêsolution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction this essay compares and contrasts different authors from the mises institute alignment to an inquiry into mises own writing in regard to the concept known as mises regression theorem.  it re-visits a question that satoshi responded to about the nature of bitcoin and the possibilities of originations of the moneyness of considered objects:  
  
""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises‚Äô axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn‚Äôt declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo‚Äôs work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,8,40,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176,117903.7017188172

from now on i plan to buy from bisq or mt pelerin without kyc and send it to another address associated with the same wallet.

my question is:

but whenever i zoom out, i always end up back at the same place: **bitcoin**. it‚Äôs not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. yet, it‚Äôs the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every ‚Äúbitcoin is dead‚Äù article.

what keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. a decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. i can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone‚Äôs permission. in times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

of course, the price volatility can be wild. i‚Äôve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. for me, it‚Äôs less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

2025-08-18 18:25:26,"btc vs real estate i'm at a cross roads. i'm at a point in my life where i've done it, i've accumulated over 1 btc. i make a (barely) livable wage (yippie, the american dream in 2025).

up to/including this point, i have minimal expenses (under $300/month). so i've been apeing my pay checks into btc since january 2024.

i moved for a promotion recently and am staying with a family member who i'm not quite compatible with.

i'm able to purchase a home in this area and it would give me a greater sense of peace to have my own space/place.

my dilemma is if i should continue using the vast amount of my pay checks to buy btc until 2028 or pull the trigger and switch tracks in my financial narrative.

doing this would mean i keep the btc i have, but won't be accumulating any more. i have enough for a down payment, and my pay checks would be going to mortgage payments/life on my own necessities.

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the ‚Äú wen lambo‚Äù crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

2025-08-19 05:33:10,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we‚Äôve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

2025-08-19 17:13:48,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

¬∑ for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
¬∑ for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,5,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9455,113404.06193584246

2025-08-19 17:25:28,"1971 broke money 1971 ‚Äî nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 ‚Äî us debt explodes  
1971 ‚Äî wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 ‚Äî dollar = debt  
1971 ‚Äî petrodollar born  
1971 ‚Äî families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 ‚Äî women pushed to work (‚Äúliberation‚Äù)

1971 didn‚Äôt change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it‚Äôs $34 trillion.

that‚Äôs not growth. that‚Äôs theft‚Äîpaid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year‚Ä¶ for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education‚Äîeverything essential‚Äîstarted outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of ‚Äúliberation.‚Äù but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me‚Ä¶

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 ‚Äî federal reserve created  
1913 ‚Äî income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed‚Äôs scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn‚Äôt lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don‚Äôt serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn‚Äôt just blood + bombs. it‚Äôs debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq‚Ä¶ all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that‚Äôs how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
üîπ us national debt ‚Üí $400b ‚Üí $34t+  
üîπ inflation steals \~97% of the dollar‚Äôs value  
üîπ wealth gap explodes  
üîπ the ‚Äúamerican dream‚Äù dies for most families  
üîπ dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don‚Äôt hold cash. they hold assets‚Äîreal estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you‚Äôre told to ‚Äúsave‚Äù while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can‚Äôt be repaid and the system collapses.

that‚Äôs why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today‚Äôs chaos‚Ä¶  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

if the u.s. or another country pegged its dollar to bitcoin, the economy would likely face massive >problems because bitcoin has a fixed supply. as the economy grows, money wouldn‚Äôt grow with it, causing prices to fall (deflation). that sounds good at first, but it makes people hoard money instead of spending or investing, and it makes debts harder to pay back. the government and federal reserve would also lose tools like lowering interest rates or creating more money to fight recessions. overall, it would make the economy rigid and unstable‚Äîsimilar to the old gold standard, but even stricter‚Äîslowing growth and making crises worse.
bitcoin would ultimately ruin our modern economy, through deflation.  something worse than inflation.

i'm not daring enough to claim it's the first magnetic board. however, i think it could be ""one of the first,"" as i haven't found one online.

it's the boards to attatch the green and red bars to update the in-game prices in real time.

its core concept is to survive against inflation and collect the most wealth points to be a winner.

we've hosted a big event in thailand to let people test the game with more than 200+ joining in. and the feedback is almost all positive.

it's on the less than 25 hours final kickstarter day to end the campaign, so you could check it out.
