many said it was impossible.

well‚Ä¶ here it is. \*\*bitsend mvp v0.3\*\* ‚Äì the first application that can:  

‚úÖ create a brand new bitcoin wallet \*\*fully offline\*\* (including address + mnemonic)  

‚úÖ register the user with otp verification  

‚úÖ send bitcoin transactions fully offline  

‚úÖ automatically broadcast them to the blockchain \*\*instantly\*\* (no ‚Äúlater‚Äù broadcasting)  



\*\*current version:\*\* works on bitcoin testnet.  

\*\*future vision:\*\* fiat integration + multi-token support (erc-20, stablecoins, etc.) alongside bitcoin.  



and yes ‚Äî this is \*\*100% my own creation\*\*, developed completely solo, without a team, without even finishing high school. all code, logic, and execution are from scratch.

2025-08-09 17:00:40,"1 bitcoin is equal to what? i read a quote form saylor saying that is us buys bitcoin other countries might have to buy bitcoin at $50m.

for perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth 

$1,050,000,000,000,000

a quadrillion?

that‚Äôs crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

rough esitmates say there‚Äôs only 2.4 billion us dollars - everything else is made up imaginary dollars and debt.

but if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it‚Äôs 50,000 times higher

and if there‚Äôs a sliding scale 

so that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

ridiculous.

i say all of that to say - as many of you know - bitcoin can‚Äôt be equated to dollars

bitcoin vs the price of a gallon of gasoline?
the cost of a loaf of bread?
an average sized home?

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today‚Äôs 118k price is scary high, especially if you‚Äôre used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don‚Äôt look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn‚Äôt find one, unless you look back in history‚Ä¶ lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it‚Äôs relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i‚Äôm on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc‚Ä¶) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850‚Äôs) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc ‚Äî thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven‚Äôt heard from ai) hey all ‚Äî long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i‚Äôm coming from and what i‚Äôm considering. i‚Äôve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
‚Ä¢ i contributed to my school district‚Äôs 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory ‚Äî terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn‚Äôt appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
‚Ä¢ i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there‚Äôs a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1‚Äì2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
‚Ä¢ separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that‚Äôs being paid down aggressively.
‚Ä¢ now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i‚Äôm seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i‚Äôd put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don‚Äôt gamble, pay down debt, don‚Äôt lever into volatile assets. i get that. i‚Äôm asking this community for perspectives i haven‚Äôt considered ‚Äî practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
‚Ä¢ i believe in bitcoin‚Äôs long-term thesis ‚Äî adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it‚Äôs likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
‚Ä¢ i really don‚Äôt want to liquidate my existing btc position ‚Äî emotionally and strategically i‚Äôd rather hold. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm disciplined on repayment timelines and i‚Äôm comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i‚Äôm trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you‚Äôd known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i‚Äôm considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this ‚Äî how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt gamble.‚Äù i‚Äôm looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i‚Äôm curious about: partial loan ‚Üí partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced ‚Äî stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who‚Äôs been through a leveraged crypto move ‚Äî how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
‚Ä¢ i‚Äôm not asking whether crypto is risky ‚Äî i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
‚Ä¢ i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i‚Äôm trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
‚Ä¢ i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you‚Äôre going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn‚Äôt, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i‚Äôve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the ‚Äútalking points‚Äù for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: ‚Äúbitcoin has no intrinsic value‚Äù. ‚Äúbitcoins value is unreliable and subjective‚Äù. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, ‚Äú*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop¬≠erties that are valued by acting men.‚Äù*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing.¬†

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.‚Äù[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok.¬†

the words ""intrinsic"" and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, ‚Äúthe philosophical definition is wrong and it‚Äôs not what intrinsic value means‚Äù is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion.¬†

1. ‚Äúsubject‚Äù - any being or living thing.
2. ‚Äúvalue judgement‚Äù - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim)¬†
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.)¬†
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently ‚Äî just that we‚Äôve never seen it happen.)¬†
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects.¬†
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects.¬†
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve.

2. eth wakes up (+- current situation) and we have a gigantic volatility on eth/btc chart, money moves between those 2 + some major alts. eth folks, after being ridiculed for year(s) with btc/eth charts, start to get some confidence and we get the classical flippening yelling. eth is gonna flip/overtake btc (which of course will never happen)
3. eth season is done and we have a situation where money flows from eth into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). there will be several cycles, not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump. alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping.
4. finally, once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

the latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into btc again. the alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ath (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

you also don't keep all of your converted btc when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for fiat (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. you can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 10-20% apy while your fiat gets you close to zero apy when you move it to your bankster's place.

once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy btc again because nobody is buying btc at atl except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top = ath hopefully) and finally 25% that's left for one last profit taking.

basically, you sell gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto and sell heavily +- 50% of your bag when you feel that this is gonna be as good as it gets (you'll never get the top so anything close to it = before and/or after ath is great).

i'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. ok, bye.

edit: i decided to use the comedy flair because most of you will fail, yet again, to follow the simple rules of profit taking, ending up being the exit liquidity + eternal bag holders. comedy and tragedy, a very thin line indeed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mn7vjs/how_to_take_profits_like_a_pro_during_the/,754,181,1mn7vjs,reddit,0.9775,121631.06594087846

strike, coinos, and lnvoltz offer powerful, free apis that make it easy to integrate btc payments into your site or e-commerce store.

2025-08-11 12:45:54,"what would happen hello, this is a legitimate question for the community, so here it is. if the majority of money that has been dumped into bit coin is usd, i'm just going to make up a number 70 percent (tried to research the actual number but couldnt find any data). 

now let's say the us dollar collapses because they can no longer service their national debt.  let's say the us dollar is worth 1/10th of what it usually is. 

would this also drop bitcoin by almost the same amount considering how much investment was made originally in usd? or does bitcoin price stay the same because once the coin is bought it doesnt have a direct relationship to the currency it was purchased with?

on one hand it could be treated as it's own commodity and could retain its value on the world market, it would just cost 10 times more usd to buy a coin. 

but on the other hand if people started cashing out their bitcoin into usd theoretically the ""stockpile"" of usd that went into it wouldnt be enough to service all the people who wanted to cash out.

would love to hear peoples insight on what they believe would happen, or maybe you actually know how it all works and there is a finite answer.

passkey:

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

2025-08-11 13:37:46,"would you invest in post-quantum cryptos if they hit tier 1 exchanges? quantum computers are getting closer to breaking ecdsa, the lowest-hanging fruit in crypto security. if that happens, roughly 25% of bitcoin wallets could be at risk.

we don‚Äôt know exactly when a powerful enough quantum computer will be built, but it‚Äôs clear that it will happen sooner or later. most current blockchains, including bitcoin and ethereum, would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. efforts are underway to upgrade these blockchains, but it‚Äôs a challenging process that will take time ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no guarantee the fixes will be ready before the threat becomes real.

it‚Äôs worth noting that there are already post-quantum cryptocurrencies designed to withstand this risk from the start. they use quantum-safe signature schemes like xmss or sphincs+, which cannot be broken by shor‚Äôs algorithm. a few of these coins are live today, but most are only available on small, niche exchanges with low liquidity.  


**questions for you:**

1. should quantum-resistant cryptos be listed on tier 1 exchanges like binance, coinbase, or kraken?   
a) yes  
b) no

2. after such a listing, i would:  
a) stick to mainstream crypto only, so no impact to me.

so i figured i'd try again. went to sign up, and again i was rejected for...reasons. the only reason i tried again is because they responded to a review i left on google. but, alas, same exact issue and when i tried to reach out to their support email they sent me the same automated response i got before.

doesn't seem worth fighting to use the platform, even though i really liked the potential offerings! just curious if maybe anyone else had an issue like this that they were able to fix? or maybe if there's another similar option to try (i know of strike/bitcoin well)?

for the last two years, i've been following a strict dca plan: 10% of my paycheck goes to fiat savings, and 10% goes to bitcoin. the good news is that i've finally hit my primary goal: ***my fiat savings now covers a full 6 months of living expenses.***

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

here‚Äôs the play:

* the us holds **261.5m ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices ü§Ø).
* market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.
* if revalued, treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the fed, instantly crediting **\~$900b** without selling a single bar.
* no new debt, just‚Ä¶ magic money backed by gold.

it‚Äôs been done before:

* **1933:** fdr confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.
* **1971‚Äì73:** nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, treasury revalued, pocketed \~$800m without selling gold.

why now?

* fed‚Äôs own memo (aug 1) points to other countries doing it ‚Äî germany, italy, lebanon, south africa.
* analysts like luke gromen say revaluing to **$20k/oz** could free up **$5t**, slashing us debt-to-gdp from 122% ‚Üí \~70%.
* trump‚Äôs treasury officials are hinting it‚Äôs ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù

the crypto twist:

* last year, sen. cynthia lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy bitcoin** for a us strategic reserve ‚Äî ‚Äúbudget-neutral.‚Äù
* trump‚Äôs crypto advisor called it ‚Äúthe best way‚Äù to get btc without taxing americans.

why this matters for bitcoin:

1. if fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets ‚Äî gold *and* btc.
2. state-level btc accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.
3. but‚Ä¶ big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.

everyone loves to talk about ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù and ‚Äúfree markets‚Äù but most of you are still sitting with coins on exchanges, doing your taxes and trusting the same government you say you hate.

if you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, monero is how you actually do it.

so you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it‚Äôs now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. they took zero risk in that trade. when banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. when you win, they take a cut. when you lose, they vanish.

monero fixes that. nobody knows your 50 bucks of btc turned into 2k if you swap through monero. no blockchain trail, no reporting, no ‚Äúoops, i forgot to declare my gains‚Äù with your name all over a public ledger.

and for those who support drug legalization‚Ä¶ you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren‚Äôt using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you‚Äôre just talking. monero enables that market today.

when talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. they'll say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs only a small percent of the volume‚Äù or ‚Äúfiat is worse.‚Äù screw that. the answer should be ‚Äúfuck yes it‚Äôs used for this, that‚Äôs the point‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck taxes, fuck government overreach‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat does your shitcoin do for the average person?‚Äù

someone actually commented on the video saying ""its not ok"", and how they ""dont know what the solution is"" (to which i obviously replied with a one word answer), but since developing my interest in bitcoin just 18 months ago, it has become so much more obvious how gradual degradation of fiat, general complacency and a system i suspect intentionally designed to keep people working has resulted in such an abysmal situation that is only getting worse.

not because i wanted to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton ‚Äî not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to ‚Äúset and forget,‚Äù but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper‚Ä¶ but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i‚Äôm sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let‚Äôs suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don‚Äôt want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france‚Äôs reputation for *la r√©volution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

i‚Äôve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you‚Äôre curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it‚Äôs a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i‚Äôve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:

2025-08-13 12:27:46,"what is value and price, and why bitcoin‚Äôs price will keep rising we all know the words ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and ‚Äúprice‚Äù, but what do they really mean, and what‚Äôs the difference between them? why are some things worth millions while others are worth nothing at all? what role do society, resources, time, and even culture play in shaping these concepts?

let‚Äôs start with definitions:

**value** ‚Äì a subjective perception of the importance, usefulness, or significance of something. it‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind why something matters or doesn‚Äôt.

**price** ‚Äì a quantitative expression of value (usually in money), showing exactly how much something costs in numerical terms.

for example: the item with the highest value to a human ‚Äì water ‚Äì has a low price in most regions, while a useless memecoin has no real value at all but may sometimes carry a high price.

# types of price

price is a tool for measurement and exchange.

**exchange value** ‚Äì the foundation of a market economy, showing how much other goods or money one can get for an item.  
example: 1 btc = 110,000 usd or 1 btc = 1,617 barrels of oil. in a market economy, exchange value is driven by market price, determined by supply and demand.

**imputed value** ‚Äì the estimated value of a good or service based on expert calculation, analogy, or assumed usefulness rather than market mechanisms. used in government policy, ecosystem service evaluation, social policy, tender bids, and in valuing public goods where market-based pricing is impossible.

**cost price** ‚Äì the sum of all actual expenses incurred to produce and deliver a product or service to the consumer. it includes raw materials, labor, equipment depreciation, rent, energy, taxes, and other costs. it defines the minimum price at which a product can be sold without incurring a loss.

**intrinsic value (fair value)** ‚Äì a theoretically justified valuation of an asset, company, or project based on fundamentals: profits, cash flows, assets and liabilities, growth prospects, and market risks.  
example: an investor calculates that a company‚Äôs stock is worth $100, but it trades at $70. he concludes it‚Äôs an undervalued asset and buys.

# types of value

value is multidimensional and can be classified both by its source and by how it‚Äôs perceived.

**utilitarian value** ‚Äì usefulness, ranging from life-essential (water, food, oxygen) to nearly useless (souvenirs) and even negative utility (harmful items like cigarettes). the price of highly useful goods depends on time and place. for example, a bottle of water is cheap almost everywhere, but in a desert emergency its price can skyrocket.

**emotional value** ‚Äì tied to personal feelings or memories, such as a childhood toy or a gift from a loved one. for most people, such an item is worthless, but for one person, it can be priceless.

**cultural value** ‚Äì connected to history, art, and tradition. this includes antiques, vintage items, and objects that represent important symbols (religious, national, etc.).

**social value** ‚Äì what‚Äôs important in the eyes of others. these are status-signaling items like luxury watches, expensive cars, or limited-edition sneakers. often, the brand and scarcity are the main drivers of price.

**existential value** ‚Äì things that cannot be expressed in monetary terms: freedom, life, love, worldview.

# factors affecting price

here are 15 key factors that shape the final price:

1. production costs (cost price)
2. rarity
3. supply and demand (plus liquidity)
4. competition
5. government regulation
6. logistics
7. technological level
8. brand and image
9. marketing and packaging
10. consumer psychology
11. traditions and culture
12. currency exchange rates
13. inflation
14. financial bubbles
15. geopolitics and crises

# why bitcoin‚Äôs price will rise

bitcoin is a completely new asset class. it‚Äôs not a commodity, stock, or bond, so traditional valuation methods like intrinsic value or fair value don‚Äôt apply.

what it does have: cost of production, average market price, trading volumes, and liquidity.

bitcoin through the 15 price factors:

1. cost price ‚Äì driven by mining costs, mainly electricity and taxes. halving increases cost price over time.
2. rarity ‚Äì supply limited to 21 million btc; decreasing over time due to lost keys.
3. supply and demand ‚Äì 560m crypto holders, $10‚Äì20b spot volume, $40‚Äì60b with futures & etfs. etfs expand access.
4. competition ‚Äì altcoins are not real competitors; the only rival is gold.
5. government regulation ‚Äì u.s. acceptance is a global green light; states and companies now hold btc.
6. logistics ‚Äì irrelevant except for transaction fees.
7. technology ‚Äì debated, but simple, reliable, decentralized.
8. brand ‚Äì bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency.
9. marketing ‚Äì best ad is rising price.
10. consumer psychology ‚Äì veblen effect boosts demand.
11. traditions & culture ‚Äì btc is culturally neutral.
12. currencies ‚Äì correlated with usd.
13. inflation ‚Äì makes btc attractive, especially in high-inflation countries.
14. bubbles ‚Äì bitcoin thrives in speculative growth cycles.
15. geopolitics ‚Äì potential to behave like gold in crises.

# conclusion

bitcoin is almost the perfect asset for price growth, as it checks nearly all key factors driving value higher. the only serious threats are mining pool collusion (51% attack) and quantum computing, both unlikely in the near term. other risks may cause short-term drops but aren‚Äôt existential.

zooming out, we‚Äôre still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn‚Äôt yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you‚Äôve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

if you get oversold price action that crashes into oblivion, then when the market recovers and is well gain, you can get insane over-buying as a natural reaction. kind of like ""for every action, there is an opposite reaction"".

then the insane melt-up crashes back down. rinse and repeat.

# what "" parabolic"" price action?

every cycle has had its final months go into a fomo run, then a mania melt-up into parabolic price action.

# where are we so far?

it's hard to say yet. we could be somewhere in between these two sides of the spectrum:

1- we could be on the very flatline before a major parabolic melt-up that will dwarf all this year's price action.

2- or this could be a milder melt-up like 2021, and we could be already more than halfway into a milder parabolic run.

# what perfect storm of events could help fuel a melt-up?

**-fear desensitization: heavy market fear for over a year, but with no consequences as the price still gets new aths:**

first off, it always helps when the market has already had most of its major fear out of the way.

and it might even have been increasingly desensitized from fear.

the market has already gone through months in recent years of fears of threats of nuclear war, major recession, tariff wars, covid variants, economic trouble all around the world, along with monthly crypto fud we had for over a year, from the crypto banking collapse to the recent xmr fear of a 51% attack. it's been one after another.

there's been an overload of fear, now mostly blown over, that will make it difficult to out-do.

it might even turn into a boy who cried wolf situation, even if there is legitimate fear coming up.

especially now that people see that despite all the fear we had, it didn't stop bitcoin from going past $120k.

**-m1 m2 money supply** has been climbing more sharply, and is forecast to continue this trend. while bitcoin has been falling behind. this is probably the trend that the crypto market has loved following the most, historically.

https://preview.redd.it/qgwqv4nrusif1.jpg?width=1166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04d22d419f5044fbbaff9ecb8f964be1a03b7f42

**-fed rate cuts.**

fed cuts haven't even started yet. it's unlikely we have even seen the biggest gains yet without any cuts started.

**- crypto etfs, 401ks, sovereign funds, coporate funds, etc...**

there's more and more of these big funds loading up on crypto. and some have only just started. it's starting to also look like they might be moving into alts also.

**-continuously pro-crypto us government, along with other nations warming up to crypto.**

the us government has continued its pro-crypto policies, as seen with its most recent bills to help the crypto space. but if you look around the world, it's not the only government that's increasingly more pro-crypto. one interesting area are the gulf states, which haven't been talked about much, but seem to be increasingly pro-crypto, and are rumored to be working on their own crypto sovereign funds.

**-fud and negative narratives are fading from mainstream media, and getting increasingly replaced by hype.**

there is still the occasional fud story, but if you look at when mainstream media has talked about crypto these past months, it's decreasingly less about ""scam"" and ""criminal money"" narratives, and increasingly more about ""big gains"", ""bull market"", ""technology"", ""pro-crypto policies"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mp7itl/the_crypto_bull_market_hasnt_even_gone_full/,293,87,1mp7itl,reddit,-0.9969,121125.28687546166

i've been in crypto since the 2020 crash and subsequent market boom in 2021. last time around, as crypto was heating up, there was a noted rise in public comment: an nfl player requesting his salary in bitcoin instead of dollars, bitcoin purchase stations being added to us gas stations, and even that goddamn superbowl commercial.

it was a time for trotting out a longtime crypto concept: everyone feels like a genius in the boom times.

once bitcoin got mentioned on my dad's local news station, even he started talking about it, and how his (elderly) neighbors were all aware that it was a crazy scam.

the real sign of the times, though, was when my co-workers decided to start talking about bitcoin and their ""altcoin portfolios"" at lunch. mind you: these are people who don't own stocks, laughed at me when i told them i used our company's 401-k matching offer, and let multiple people know that their ultimate retirement plan is to win a couple of big scratch-off lottery tickets. (you know, because if they buy a few every week for life, they're ""guaranteed"" to win a big one or two.)

then the bubble burst and my co-workers all shut the hell up about crypto except for one who admitted their paper hands folding. (i suspect all of them traded at a loss instead of waiting 5 years for this run-up.)

anyway, the circle is becoming complete again: my co-worker lunch table is talking loudly about doge and other altcoins and how they're going to get vacation homes soon.

sotheby‚Äôs fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag¬†dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at¬†us $23 million for instance, one never says ‚Äòused‚Äô referring to such items. they are¬†always preowned.

¬†the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar¬†hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40¬†year old handbag. obviously it‚Äôs been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is¬†singularly unique. created by herm√®s for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it¬†possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still¬† it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point,¬†suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic herm√®s style.

¬†how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, ‚Äújewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.‚Äù

# diamonds are a single harvest¬†

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that‚Äôs it.

# bitcoin benefits

i understand enough economics to believe inflation and currency debasement are long-term risks, and i feel a responsibility to warn people.

i live in a high cost area making $30/hr. most of my friends earn similar or less.

i believe bitcoin will capture excess liquidity over time, and that waiting could be costly.

my urgency is not always matched by their readiness. what i see as a lifeboat can feel to them like i am telling them their ship is sinking. this mismatch has made me push too hard at times.

i understand most will say to forget these people and stack silently. i will, but i have to acknowledge the emotional burden that comes with it.

not ‚Äúlike‚Äù electricity‚Ä¶ but behaving *as* electricity in an engineering sense:

* **btc = electrons** ‚Äî the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** ‚Äî the push that drives the current.
* **miners = generators** ‚Äî converting real-world energy into unforgeable monetary signal.
* **financial instruments (like mstr‚Äôs capital stack) = circuit components** ‚Äî switches, resistors, capacitors, magnetic fields‚Ä¶ each shaping or routing the bitcoin current in a unique way.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it‚Äôs not a stock, not a company ‚Äî it‚Äôs the base layer of a new monetary grid.

but most importantly, i feel the upgrades have had an immense impact in the price action such as eip-1559 that improved the efficiency of the network and brought in fee burning to decrease the inflationary pressures we saw.

macd & rsi at rock bottom. on the weekly timeframe, both indicators are sitting in some of the lowest zones we‚Äôve seen in ages. historically, that‚Äôs been a strong reversal signal.

stablecoin legislation in the us. new laws and regulatory clarity could push issuers to mint more stablecoins. more stables = more liquidity flowing into the market.

trump‚Äôs pension fund bill. allows us retirement funds to allocate to crypto. that‚Äôs a whole new class of institutional money.

etf momentum beyond btc & eth. we‚Äôre seeing a wave of altcoin etf filings, and big firms are starting to position themselves around alts, not just bitcoin.

google search spikes. ‚Äúaltcoin‚Äù and ‚Äúethereum‚Äù searches are at multi-year highs. retail attention is heating up.

cycle pattern. btc pumps first, then eth, then the alts. we‚Äôre right in that middle stage now.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa‚Äôs commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.**¬†this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa‚Äôs leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time.

well i hope i did the right thing by jumping on the wagon today. i never really heard of bitcoin or actively processed the word, until a friend mentioned it in passing conversation a few weeks ago.

'bitcoin'?.. what's *that* about?..   something really made curious enough though to read and watch videos (thank you 'explains 101') so to educate myself on what it is and how it works.

right now, we‚Äôre seeing a familiar pattern: btc and eth surged, and now prices are starting to dip again. it‚Äôs the same story every cycle. new people jump in during the hype, the price goes up even more, and then reality sets in. those who over-invested or put in more than they can afford to lose become nervous, scared and highly reactive to negative change. a small drop in price occurs, and suddenly, the emotional chain reaction of sell-offs begins. huge drop in price incoming.

when this happens, just take a breath.

this kind of volatility is normal. what you‚Äôre seeing is weak hands getting shaken out. it‚Äôs not the end. it never is.

the best advice i can give: **zoom out**. look at the big picture. over any 2‚Äì3 year period in crypto history, if you held strong and didn‚Äôt try to trade every wave, you were likely rewarded. crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. it‚Äôs a long game.

3. generate a pin for cold card q and a 24 word seed phrase.
4. generate wallet address to be able to receive from river directly without a third party wallet.

to send:

1. put in microsd card for cold card q and link it to sparrow. sparrow from my understanding is a wallet i can use to receive or send out bitcoin anywhere, in my case i would be sending bitcoin from sparrow to an exchange to be able to sell if needed.

i would then stamp my seed phrase into a titanium plate and put it in a safety secuity deposit box with an air tag.

2025-08-15 01:20:29,"why do people think their blockchains are fully on chain? **look into the blockchain you invest in.**  
do not just take the marketing material or a social media post at face value. take the time to understand how it works, where it runs, and who controls it. many people assume that because something is called a blockchain it is automatically fully on chain, but that is rarely the case. aside from value focused blockchains like bitcoin, and execution focused blockchains such as ethereum, the only major platform that runs everything including compute, storage, governance, and execution fully on chain is the internet computer protocol. most others are hybrids at best or partially centralized ledgers presented as blockchains.

when we talk about a blockchain being on chain we are talking about more than just recording transactions in a public ledger. it means the application logic, state changes, and data storage actually live on the blockchain itself where they are verifiable, tamperproof, and run without reliance on third party servers. in a true on chain model, everything from the code to the data is hosted and executed by the decentralized network. remove a node or even multiple nodes and the system continues running because no part of it depends on a single party‚Äôs infrastructure.

most blockchains do not operate this way. they run a consensus layer on chain to record transactions, but push the heavy lifting off chain. smart contracts often store pointers to data rather than the data itself. applications usually run their frontends and backends on centralized services like aws, google cloud, or other traditional hosting. even in networks with many validators, the core application stack can still be dependent on centralized infrastructure for hosting, computation, or indexing. if that off chain infrastructure goes down, the application breaks even if the ledger is still technically online.

this hybrid setup creates several problems. it weakens the tamperproof claim because if your backend logic or user interface is controlled by a single company it can be altered or shut down without consensus from the network. it increases the attack surface because hacks and exploits often occur when the off chain backend or bridge is compromised. these incidents are not blockchain ledger breaches but failures caused by centralized components that sit outside the chain.

we see this pattern repeatedly. the headlines about millions of dollars stolen from a protocol often trace back to a compromised front end, a faulty library, or an insecure key. the blockchain ledger itself remains untouched, but because the application logic lives off chain, an attacker can reroute funds or trick users into approving malicious transactions. these incidents happen because the system was never truly self contained on chain to begin with.

icp was built to avoid this problem entirely. its architecture allows developers to deploy canisters, which are smart contracts that can contain both code and data, directly to the blockchain. the frontend, backend, and database can all be hosted on chain and served directly from the network to the user‚Äôs browser without intermediaries. this removes the need for aws buckets, centralized backends, or hidden infrastructure dependencies. the code running your application is exactly what you can verify on the blockchain.

ethereum offers an open execution environment where smart contracts live on chain and run without central servers. however, because ethereum is expensive and slower for high volume storage and complex computation, many applications built on ethereum rely on off chain infrastructure for parts of their stack. this is a practical trade off, but it blurs the line between being on chain and being merely anchored to a blockchain.

value based blockchains like bitcoin operate differently. they focus entirely on securing the transfer of value and maintaining a censorship resistant ledger. they do not claim to run applications or host data on chain, so they avoid the mismatch between expectation and reality. their simplicity contributes to their security.

for other blockchains, the marketing often paints a picture of a fully decentralized self contained system when that is not the truth. the moment you realize that the application you use depends on a centralized backend you should also realize that the guarantees of decentralization and tamperproof operation no longer fully apply. this is why so many exploits are possible. attackers target the weak links, and in most so called blockchains, those weak links are off chain.

if you are investing in a project, understand the difference between a ledger on chain and a full application on chain. ledger only platforms can be fine for certain use cases, but they will never provide the same guarantees as a network where the entire stack, from smart contract logic to user facing code, is decentralized. icp proves that it is possible. the question is whether the others even want to try, because moving to a fully on chain architecture would require fundamentally rethinking their business models and governance structures.

until then, the next time someone claims their favorite blockchain is fully on chain, ask them where the application logic runs, where the data lives, and what happens if their chosen cloud provider shuts down for a week. if they cannot answer without naming a centralized service, you will know exactly how on chain it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mqji9q/why_do_people_think_their_blockchains_are_fully/,16,91,1mqji9q,reddit,0.0971,118319.47330275648

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

i have a large group of friends and a big family, and i‚Äôd love to motivate them to get into bitcoin by gifting them a small amount - for example as a birthday gift, wedding gift, or for any other occasion.

the challenge: many of them don‚Äôt have a bitcoin wallet yet. ideally, i‚Äôd like to gift them a hardware wallet with the bitcoin already on it.

what‚Äôs the safest and most practical way to give bitcoin to someone who has no wallet yet? are there solutions that don‚Äôt require them to set one up beforehand?

now, its a consistent decline, any advice will be highly appreciate.

below is copied from coinmarketcap

spark (spk) fell 6.68% in 24h, extending a 29% weekly decline despite a 139% 30-day rally. key factors:

1. profit-taking after rally - spk surged 37% last week, triggering sell-offs near $0.126 resistance.

2. bearish technicals - oversold rsi (33) and macd divergence signal weak momentum.

i wanted some opinions/suggestions/assistance with a current crypto situation.

a guy i'm dating suggested this new coin. so i pumped almost $1500 into a ca and want to cash out or at least ""send"" it to myself on cashapp and cash it out to my bank account. 

the guy i'm seeing said i need to put another $500 into the ca in order for it to be able to swap or cash it out. but, based on what my base app is telling me, i just need some assets that are on the bnb network (same network as this new coin), and i can then swap it out to a ca of my choice, which would be the bitcoin wallet connected to my cashapp. 

the guy i'm dating originally told me after the first or second infusion of cash to the ca he sent me, that i would be able to withdraw. then it was ""okay, one more time and you should be able to cash out,"" but now he's saying it needs one more infusion of cash in order to make it be eligible to cash out!!!

and he's also saying that the ca is closing tomorrow and all the $ in my wallet will be worth nothing. it's of note that last weekend he also told me the ca was closing, but he said it was set to close ""on monday,"" as in this past monday, 4 days ago!!!

screenshot is  attached for reference. any information and/or resources you can point me to would be greatly appreciated!!! and, i specifically want to know the following:

1. is he just asking me to put more $ in so he can just take my $ for himself in his own ca/wallet and scamming me?
2. is this the normal for crypto? you have to put money in a ca then that ca account pushed money back to you? 
3. when a ca closes, does that truly render the funds in my wallet useless?
4. if it's not useless, can i do the following to get the $ to my bank account? 
    * buy another coin that's also on the bnb network to have it as an asset -> go to my wallet and ""send"" the funds to the ca -> connected to my cashapp crypto wallet -> cash out my cashapp crypto  wallet to my bank account connected to my cashapp
5. if the above is not the case, how should i go about trying to get the funds out of my wallet?? and is timing a factor for this (ie the ca ""closing"" and all that??

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions‚Äîlike fear and greed‚Äîthat those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,5,16,1mrjzn5,reddit,0.9955,117533.98734372148

2025-08-16 04:53:37,"bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‚Äêsolution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction this essay compares and contrasts different authors from the mises institute alignment to an inquiry into mises own writing in regard to the concept known as mises regression theorem.  it re-visits a question that satoshi responded to about the nature of bitcoin and the possibilities of originations of the moneyness of considered objects:  
  
""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises‚Äô axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn‚Äôt declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo‚Äôs work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,4,12,1mrl65c,reddit,-0.5176,117903.7017188172

2025-08-16 08:46:34,"which wallet to use? hi all,

i know that a cold wallet is the safest way. i‚Äôm searching for a wallet on my iphone. i downloaded cake and exodus so far. 

i noted the phrases and so on. what i don‚Äôt understand is, if cake wallet shuts down the business or takes the app offline. can i then recover the wallet in another app using my phrases?

what i‚Äôd also like to know is, are there different fees when transferring crypto, or is the network fee always the same no matter which wallet i use?

i want to store btc/eth/xmr in my wallet.

thank you for your help and sorry for these beginner questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mrpjc6/which_wallet_to_use/,0,6,1mrpjc6,reddit,0.8095,117657.13593094652
2025-08-16 09:34:01,"bitcoin feels different this cycle, anyone else noticing it? i‚Äôve been around long enough to see bitcoin go through a few wild ups and downs, but something about this cycle feels different.

it‚Äôs not just about price action (though watching btc grind back toward new levels is exciting on its own). it‚Äôs the way the community around it has matured. you don‚Äôt see the same level of blind hype like in 2017 or even 2021. instead, i notice more people talking about *why* they‚Äôre holding, how they‚Äôre using it, and what role bitcoin actually plays in their long-term plans.

for me, i‚Äôve been stacking slowly, nothing crazy, just consistent dca. what surprises me most is how many of the people i talk to, friends, colleagues, even family, are starting to take bitcoin seriously. not as a quick trade, but as something with actual staying power.

i‚Äôm curious though‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs everyone here approaching btc right now?

* are you stacking aggressively while it‚Äôs still ‚Äúcheap‚Äù?
* just holding what you‚Äôve got and waiting it out?
* or are you in the camp that thinks the best entry was years ago and the upside is mostly gone?

would love to hear how the rest of this community is playing bitcoin in the current market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrqdg8/bitcoin_feels_different_this_cycle_anyone_else/,1,0,1mrqdg8,reddit,0.9838,117657.13593094652
