2025-08-19 05:33:10+00:00,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we‚Äôve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

i know it's kinda late that we're on reddit in this final day. but i know we should. today it's on the very final kickstarter day. so if you love what we do, please, mates, support us on kickstarter.

2025-08-19 01:23:40+00:00,"dca volumes per month.. how does retail dca compare to institutional buying? what do you all think the volume of dca from plebs like us is compared to institutional buying?  i know there are hourly, daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly dca from hodlers. most of btc is still held by individuals. is this the new floor to a large dip or is it really institutional and sovereign buying?

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the ‚Äú wen lambo‚Äù crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

if i had a chance to go deeper i would ask a person what work is. and explain how humanity literally expends their life force to get money. nothing is more valuable than a persons life. therefore when a government prints money they are committing an unpardonable sin. devaluing the life force of humanity.

people look at bitcoin as some mysterious voodoo magic. sure lots of people have heard about some old lost cousin that made a bag buying the funny computer coins, but you'd get laughed at for implying bitcoin is anything other than just that.

people here hold their life savings in their bank accounts and dont even consider the effects inflation has. risk tolerance is extremely low.

from my point of view, direct adoption of bitcoin is impossible here. i genuinely don't see any future for it.

doing this would mean i keep the btc i have, but won't be accumulating any more. i have enough for a down payment, and my pay checks would be going to mortgage payments/life on my own necessities.
