2025-07-09 01:09:13+00:00,advice help please - i’m currently using crypto.com and want to switch to coinbase or kraken. i don’t want to lose money in ridiculous fees. and i believe when you move to a different platform it buys it at the current price? i opened a coinbase account and tested this a bit ago. i sent a small amount of bitcoin from current exchange to my new one and it only reflected the amount at the current price and not what i bought it for. i’m clearly more novice to this and just need some advice on what to do. thanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lv5uxg/advice/,6,4,1lv5uxg,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-09 00:52:33+00:00,"new to crypto hey everyone. long story short i'm new to crypto. my coworker/buddy got me into it and i'm trying to gather as much information as possible to make the best decisions possible. virtually all of my investing is retirement based (s&p 500 for my forecasted retirement year) coming directly out of my paycheck from my employer. i felt like crypto was a good opportunity to have different things in my portfolio. therefore, i have a couple of questions

1.) what are you guys liking the look of moving forward (besides btc). between reddit and friends who seemingly know what they're doing, 
i hear a lot about xlm, xrp, icp, link, hbar, and algo. 

2.) what criteria do you consider when investing in particular coins? 

3.) where do you get your crypto news/insight from besides reddit?

hopefully this post doesn't seem too rudimentary.  appreciate any help and insight!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lv5iwg/new_to_crypto/,4,33,1lv5iwg,reddit,CryptoMarkets
