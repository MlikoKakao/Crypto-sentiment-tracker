does sol, avax, link, etc any of these have a chance to run high like btc and eth do?

2025-07-30 20:21:13+00:00,"fed holds rates as expected but crypto markets already pricing in the boring outcome, here's what happens next so the fomc meeting wrapped up with exactly what everyone expected rates staying at current levels. no surprise cuts, no hawkish surprises, just powell doing his usual ""we're data dependent"" routine. but the crypto reaction (or lack thereof) tells us way more about where we're headed.

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,65,13,1mdhcve,reddit,CryptoMarkets
2025-07-30 20:00:06+00:00,"how can there be an altseason if people are excepting one? i don't remember the term altseason coming into use until after spring 2018. maybe it was used before that but i don't remember it (i have been in since 2013).

in very early 2017 no one was expecting a massive alt rally. it happened because some people thought btc would be replaced with currency coins and there would be use for other more fancy projects. alts did rally in previous years to but not like 2017. the point being people were not expecting it at soon at btc best its 2013 high. altseason was a complete surprise.

in late 2020 alts got hammered (except eth) and btc rallied. people were selling alts into btc even when btc was well past its 2017 high. altseason came in january 2021 and many were surprised at the sudden move and came to the acceptance that we had altseason a few weeks into it. 

so today when we have btc or eth rallying many people proclaim altseason. 

maybe we need complete capitulation of alts before altseason?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdgtc0/how_can_there_be_an_altseason_if_people_are/,0,32,1mdgtc0,reddit,CryptoMarkets

2025-07-28 20:48:11+00:00,"btc dipped after getting shafted at $119k where's the momentum going? so we just watched btc drop to $117.9k today with $47.5 million getting liquidated, and honestly this whole $119k rejection is getting concerning. we've seen this level turn into a brick wall multiple times now and each attempt is getting weaker.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

anyone else getting frustrated watching this same rejection play out over and over? feels like we're stuck in groundhog day at this level.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mbrx9v/btc_dipped_after_getting_shafted_at_119k_wheres/,0,12,1mbrx9v,reddit,CryptoMarkets
