# this sol setup caught my attention due to a classic accumulation structure forming just above key weekly support. the trade was triggered at $147.50 following a measured pullback to the 1h ma50 — a level that's consistently acted as dynamic support over the last few weeks.

key confluence:

* **weekly**: price is holding above the $140–$143 base, with the 200ma flattening — signalling potential trend exhaustion rather than continuation down.
* **daily**: buyers have consistently defended the $141–$143 zone, giving confidence that this is more than just a dead-cat bounce.
* **4h**: higher lows are forming. structure looks to be shifting from bearish to neutral-bullish.
* **rsi** across timeframes is stable (not oversold), suggesting controlled consolidation — not panic selling.
* **volume** has remained steady during the range, supporting an accumulation narrative.

this is a swing, not a scalp. i'm giving this room to work, provided the structure holds. the invalidation point is clear — any breakdown through $141 and this trade thesis fails.

# profit management

i’m using a staged exit to lock in gains progressively and ride any extended move:

* **tp1** (50%): $156.00 – first resistance, locking in profits and reducing risk.
* **tp2** (30%): $165.00 – main target based on the width of the consolidation range.
* **tp3** (20%): $175.00 – extended target into weekly resistance zone. would need clean breakout + volume.

# key price levels

* **pivot**: $150.30
* **support zones**: $141.5 / $143.0 / $147.5
* **4h levels**: support – 143.02 / 147.51, resistance – 158.27 / 167.50
* **daily resistance**: 167.50 / 175.43

# risk factors to monitor

* a decisive break below $141 would invalidate the setup.
* sol typically follows btc on major moves — if bitcoin tanks, expect sol to follow.
* watch general crypto market sentiment. even clean technicals won’t hold up in a widespread sell-off.

# ""tachyon: scaling zcash with oblivious synchronization

zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. they provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. in short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

to enable this, zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. these proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. but the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-snarks](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“zk”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **we can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** we've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**now it’s time to cross the finish line.** i am proposing several protocol changes in zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. the crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that i refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. this new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** in the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. in order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “sapling” upgrade from earlier in zcash's history. back then, we set out to make zk-snarks practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. the sophistication of the sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)proof-carrying data

early in the history of zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-snarks. as mentioned, the [sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. however, zk-snarks are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. this has led to a misconception that zk-snarks are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in zcash.

in reality, we've never actually considered zk-snark verification a barrier to scaling zcash. i once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being snarkpack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

the ultimate tool for scaling zk-snark verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (pcd)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/ct10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind zcash. crudely speaking, pcd allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. this can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

pcd languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. this changed when our team at the electric coin company discovered [halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving pcd with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. as mentioned before, this led to a cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made pcd table stakes for new scalable protocols. pcd can be leveraged to make zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) as we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

zk-snarks and pcd are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. however, privacy-preserving protocols like zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

there are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* how do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* how do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* how are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-snarks (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. by being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-snarks and pcd.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)shielded notes and commitments

shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [utxos](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in bitcoin. we aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-snark to prove that various rules are being followed. in order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

the commitment hides the note, but the zk-snark can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. this allows the zk-snark proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). in order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. the standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. the user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. the user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. other people use this address to make a payment.
4. the user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

this is how bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. the user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. in private cryptocurrencies like zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. in order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. this simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **as a start, we'll be assuming that zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** the on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over signal chats. in these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. it is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [uri-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

there are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. by moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) in order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. this at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)accumulators and nullifiers

in order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accumulator_(cryptography)). currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. we call this checkpoint an “anchor.” in order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

in order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. this works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-snark proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

if we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **the zk-snark helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** the nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**the scalability bottlenecks that remain in zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)oblivious synchronization

it'll be helpful to recast what a zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

the wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. in each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. in all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. as long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-snark proof and spend the funds. (the wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) this is more or less how our wallets currently work.

my vision for scaling zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-snark proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** this means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. this effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

the result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) as a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

it would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain pcd of the wallet state. this expense is not just due to the cost of creating pcd proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

however, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the pcd proofs) to a third party that i call an **oblivious syncing service**. this service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

we already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomorphic_encryption) (fhe). **but by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use pcd.** the remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. one would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

in practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. but this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. fortunately, as i'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#project-tachyon)project tachyon

this new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. the main changes involved include:

* **wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ecc has already begun exploring the incoporation of uri-encapsulated payments into its zashi mobile wallet. different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the zcash protocol. it also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** this involves implementing and deploying a pcd-based proof aggregation protocol for orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. this can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** this can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in pcd.** i've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. this will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **in-band secret distribution must be removed in zcash.** this can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **the payment protocol should allow wallet pcd state to augment the zk-snark in transactions.** this final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. this can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**i call this the tachyon project for zcash.** i'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. my goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. as with all of our previous network upgrades i'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

crucially, i don't plan to stand in the way of any other zcash protocol improvements while i see tachyon to fruition. i'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and i'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. i also have no reason to believe that tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as crosslink and zsas; in fact, i have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for tachyon.

there are many things i'll be sharing over the coming weeks. i'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that i've developed to be compatible with the orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. this should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

## july payment statistics

we added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. monero

we have to start with **monero**.

it's eating up everything else in our pie chart. xmr now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

genuine props to the monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. nano

second biggest is once again **nano**. our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

it's also being integrated into btcpayserver right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the lightning network.

average btc transaction size was $24.48, while lightning's was $4.42. as expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. litecoin

digital silver **litecoin** plus the recently added litecoin mweb added up to 6.7%.

6.59% litecoin, 0.11% specifically mweb.

to be fair - we only added mweb payments about 7 days ago! read the blog for more on our mweb integration.

# honorable mention: zcash

finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **zcash** with 3.44%.

all the more remarkable given that zec payments were only added 2 weeks ago, and the much-requested shielded pay-in addresses a few days ago. 

# the full data

here's the complete breakdown for all coins:

* xmr: 52.91%
* xno: 17.71%
* btc: 10.20%
* ltc: 6.59%
* eth: 3.57%
* zec: 3.44%

* ban: 0.12%
* ltc-mweb: 0.11%
* kas: 0.05%
* egld: 0.01%
* pol: 0.01%

# kaspa, multiversx, dash, bitcoin cash

unfortunately as you can see kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

we know there are a lot of kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some kaspa people to hear how we can let kaspians know we exist!

another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was multiversx, with just 0.01% of total usage.

we know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in multiversx can get us on a podcast to explain nanogpt, we're all ears!

in a similar vein the typical payment coins like bitcoin cash and dash do not see the amount of usage on nanogpt that you would expect. we clearly need to up our outreach there!

some key details:

• decibel acts as a full-stack exchange engine. it lets users trade spot and perpetuals from a single multicollateral account (supports apt, usdc, btc, eth, sol, and others).

• every trade, match, and cancel happens onchain, nothing is routed offchain.

• liquidity is unified across products. protocol vaults and user-managed vaults can both contribute to market-making.

• supports direct onboarding from other chains and cexs, with no new seed phrases needed.

• the underlying aptos blockchain is designed for high throughput and fast block times (currently 120ms, aiming for sub-20ms), which enables cex-like performance.

aptos defi has been growing steadily this year, hitting over $1b tvl and significant stablecoin inflows (see messari’s h1 2025 aptos report for data). decibel aims to turn what’s currently a patchwork of separate protocols into a more unified and composable experience, both for users and developers.

i was late to the game in 2023, and even then only bought a small amount. about a month ago found my ledger nano and found a few thousand dollars in there. between then and now have read up again and once the republicans passed the bill that increased the debt ceiling another 5 trillion and cut taxes on the rich i knew usd was fucked (also know all the stats about money printing, never stops).

i recently quit contributing 10% to my 401k, reduced it down to get full company match. i quit contributing to my ira also (this one i’d like advice on). i now have a dca strategy of $92/day which will give me roughly $33k/year in contributions to btc.

i get quarterly bonuses from my job (around $5k net) and i’m wondering what i should do with these lump sums of cash. when i don’t know what to do i at least park it in a high yield savings account. i obviously want my cost average to be as low as possible to just shoving in lump sums at high prices given btcs volatility seems like a novice move. maybe just increase dca amount? 

does anyone still do iras? i would do roth back door since i am phased out of normal roth contribution limits.

don’t want to be an idiot on tax free gains and compounding interest. switching to an hsa as well to get that triple tax benefit as well. i just want to be as smart as possible. i used to think diversification was the best tool, but diversify in fiat just makes me feel like i’m swimming upstream against my own conviction.

2025-08-07 14:51:29,"a deep dive into qrl: the quantum-safe blockchain quantum computing is no longer science fiction — it’s progressing fast. and with it comes a very real threat to the cryptography that underpins nearly every blockchain in existence.  
  
so… if quantum risk is inevitable, where do you place your bet? and is $qrl the most credible hedge in the entire crypto space? let’s break it down.  


**my discovery of quantum resistant crypto**

i’ve been interested in quantum computing for years, even investing in quantum tech etfs recently. it was clear that fields like medicine and energy would benefit from quantum — but then i started wondering about crypto. if quantum computers can break encryption that traditional systems can’t, what does that mean for bitcoin, ethereum, and the rest?  
  
i quickly learned that ecdsa, used to secure most blockchains, is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks. at first, i assumed the fix would be simple — just upgrade the cryptography. but once i dug deeper, it became clear that upgrading legacy chains would be a slow, messy process requiring global coordination.  
that led me to explore projects focused on quantum security from the start. i found a few — qrl, qanx, and cell — and eventually concluded that qrl is the most credible bet in my opinion. it’s a purpose-built blockchain using xmss at the protocol level, and the community is focused, technical, and refreshingly hype-free.  


**qrl is built different: quantum security at the core**

while most blockchains still rely on outdated signature schemes like ecdsa, qrl has used xmss — a hash-based, quantum-resistant signature algorithm — from the start. this means it doesn’t just talk about post-quantum security. it runs on it.  
  
xmss is secure against quantum attacks and doesn’t rely on factorization or elliptic curves — the very structures quantum computers are expected to break. unlike the “future upgrade paths” of legacy chains, qrl’s cryptography is already designed for a quantum world.  
  
and it gets better.  
  
with the upcoming zond platform (qrl 2.0), qrl will introduce support for sphincs+, a stateless, hash-based signature scheme recently selected for global standardization. this adds even more flexibility and resilience to qrl’s architecture, giving developers the option to choose between multiple quantum-safe primitives — all without compromising on-chain security. after the update, existing wallets remain quantum-secure and can be upgraded to the new format at any time.  


**born too early**

let’s rewind to 2018. qrl launched its mainnet. it never gained much traction in the altcoin scene and flew under the radar for years.  
  
why?

* the 2018 bear market nuked everything
* quantum risk felt 20 years away
* no smart contracts, no defi ecosystem
* devs stayed heads-down, no vc or pr push
* very limited exchange listings
* bittrex listing was a hard lesson learned

basically: wrong timing, right idea.  


**the world is catching up**

quantum computing is no longer theoretical. it’s real, it’s advancing fast, and it’s now hitting headlines that matter:

big tech is all-in: ibm, google, and many quantum specific companies such as ionq, rigetti etc. — all scaling up quantum hardware year over year with massive investments.

white house warning (july 2025): quantum computers could ""derive any digital asset holder’s private key from their public key."" and ""some experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge in the next five to ten years.""

blackrock (may 2025): etf filings flagged quantum as a direct risk to bitcoin. 

elon musk asked grok (august 2025) if quantum computers could crack sha-256. grok's answer was that sha-256 might be okay for a while. however, elon didn't ask about ecdsa which is the lowest hanging fruit for quantum computer and biggest risk currently. deloitte estimates \~25% of bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum theft due to exposed public keys.

ecdsa — the digital signature algorithm used by bitcoin, ethereum, and most wallets — is exactly what shor’s algorithm breaks. and it breaks it fast.

forbes and wsj writing about quantum threats: 

* forbes: ""the quantum threat to encryption: how businesses can future-proof""
* wsj: ""here’s how quantum computing could change the world"". ""quantum has so often been spoken about as something that was always coming in the next five or 10 years,” kohler said. “the conversations are changing dramatically because it’s now no longer 10 years down the road. it’s much closer.”



**why legacy chains can’t just “upgrade”**

many assume bitcoin or ethereum will just “switch to quantum-safe” one day.  
here’s the problem:

* protocol-level changes require global coordination
* you’d need consensus from miners, validators, exchanges, and users
* every old wallet and smart contract would need to migrate
* abandoned keys could be stolen forever
* it’s not just a software upgrade — it’s a political nightmare.

even partial fixes (like signature overlays or hybrid key pairs) won’t solve the root issue. once quantum hits, it’s not patchable — it’s a chain-wide vulnerability.  
  
bitcoin developer hunter beast discusses about the topic in the bitcoin rails podcast ""make bitcoin quantum resistant - with hunter beast"".  


**centralized systems are already preparing**

meanwhile, financial institutions are already preparing for the quantum threat. unlike decentralized blockchains, banks and centralized platforms can implement post-quantum algorithms more easily, thanks to centralized control, layered security, and fast upgrade cycles.  
  
they don’t need global consensus or to rescue abandoned wallets. they can simply roll out post-quantum security behind closed doors. the hard truth? legacy blockchains are structurally less agile when it comes to cryptographic overhauls.  


**state-level threats: quiet and strategic**

the real quantum threat may not come from hackers — but from nation-states with the budget, motive, and secrecy to act before the world catches up.

***what could they do?***

* silently drain dormant wallets with exposed public keys
* decrypt sensitive communications, from top-secret memos to financial data
* harvest encrypted traffic now, and decrypt it later with quantum power

***why it won’t be obvious***

governments wouldn’t use quantum to collapse bitcoin — especially if they’ve already restricted it domestically. instead, they’d act quietly and selectively, exploiting vulnerabilities without shaking the system.  
  
the threat isn’t chaos. it’s control — and they won’t announce when they get it.  
  
during a recent u.s. congressional oversight hearing, it was noted that:  
***“we don’t even know the names of quantum computing companies in china.""***  
— fabaiquantum, jul 1, 2025 on x  
  
the united states office of management and budget has drafted a memorandum that directs federal agencies to fully migrate to a post-quantum cryptographic standard:   
***""everything must migrate to post-quantum cryptography, cryptocurrencies included.""***  
— qdayclock, jul 17, 2025 on x



**limited listings — for now**

qrl is currently listed on just a few smaller exchanges like mexc, banxa and lbank. daily volume is low, and there’s no tier-1 listing yet. it's possible to acquire qrl but takes an extra effort.  
  
a future binance or coinbase listing would dramatically increase visibility, liquidity, and credibility. as quantum security gains attention from regulators and institutions, tier-1 exchanges may start favoring post-quantum assets — and qrl is one of the few ready now.



**community recap**

despite being one of the most technically sound projects in crypto, qrl has flown under the radar for years — and so has its community. there’s no influencer campaigns, and no hype cycles driving engagement. just a small but growing base of long-term holders, technologists, and security-minded crypto users.

* the qrl subreddit remains active with updates, research, and user-led discussions.
* devs regularly publish progress on github and engage with the community through blog posts and discord.
* the team has stayed focused on delivery — not marketing.

what you’ll find here isn’t noise — it’s signal. the community is small, but conviction is high. and as quantum awareness grows, those watching qrl now may be the earliest of the early.  


**my path to qrl owner**

after doing my due diligence about qrl, what has really convinced me was project zond (qrl 2.0). if it succeeds, developers could migrate ethereum-style smart contracts to a quantum-safe layer with minimal changes. that could be a turning point — both for qrl adoption and visibility. i believe a tier 1 listing and real marketing push could follow. so i bought in early — before the headlines hit.

to be honest, the restricted market access for qrl was almost a deal-breaker. but i believed the project had real potential, so i opened a mexc account (which seemed like a good option from europe). despite the mixed reviews, everything worked smoothly in my experience.  
  
i was able to make a fiat transfer, convert eur to usdt, buy qrl, and withdraw it to my ledger after installing the qrl app. it took a bit of extra effort — but no issues at all.

my investment horizon is 3–10+ years. by then, it’s likely that q-day has happened — and it’ll be interesting to see where qrl stands. i believe the first truly quantum-resistant blockchain will have survived the turbulence and likely attracted many crypto holders looking to protect their assets. time will tell.  


  
**tl;dr**

* qrl was too early in 2018. now it might be right on time.
* quantum computing is accelerating
* legacy chains are structurally hard to upgrade
* qrl runs quantum-safe cryptography right now
* zond adds future-ready flexibility
* institutional attention is growing
* and almost no one’s looking — yet

i posted a reply about the greek debt crisis, how goldman sachs hid their debt using credit swaps to get them accepted in to the eurozone, how goldman subsequently sold those swaps for profit, how greece proceeded to hide their debt for a decade, until ultimately they defaulted on their imf loan. i highlighted how an immutable financial ledger would have prevented this from happening. i even provided sources from prominent financial and economic publications detailing the whole thing.

the backlash was insane - those people are delusional. people calling me stupid, a conspiracy theorist, insult after insult.

what's wrong with people over there? its no secret why greece defaulted on their loan. all the information is publicly available. and an immutable financial ledger would have absoluty prevented the situation from occurring.

why are they so angry and simultaneously so completely clueless with regards to global financial engineering schemes like the greek debt crisis? this same sort of corrupt behavior is a hallmark of the current financial system.

2025-08-07 18:01:07,"i’m probably going to stop manual dca… but i need your input first dca is probably one of the best long-term strategies in crypto. 

1. no need to time the market. 
2. reduces emotional decisions 
3. less stress 
4. better average over time 
5. and above all, it helps you accumulate consistently without overthinking.

but… theory and reality don’t always line up.

i’ve been doing manual dca for about a year, trying to buy a bit of btc and eth every week. but here’s the problem:

* i often forget.
* i get influenced by price swings.
* i fomo into pumps or freeze during dips.
* and honestly, i’m getting mentally tired.

i still believe in btc. i’m here for the long run. but truthfully, i’m thinking of stopping manual dca.  
i might just calculate my average, take a break, and see where we’re at a few years from now.

but before that…

 what tools or platforms do you use to automate your dca?  
i’d love to keep it going without having to think about it every week.

i’ve already done some research and didn’t find much **except for “start a recurring buy”**, a bitget event that lets you automate dca (with a bonus), but it’s ending soon.  
that convinced me tools like this must exist. i just need something that’ll last long-term.

appreciate any insights. 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mk77y4/im_probably_going_to_stop_manual_dca_but_i_need/,9,62,1mk77y4,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9737,117463.47451085236

2025-08-07 20:38:12,"looking for feedback on a 24/7 bitcoin + monero node setup (nuc 14 essential + ssd separation) ## looking for feedback on a 24/7 bitcoin + monero node setup (nuc 14 essential + ssd separation)

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

after a few days spent exploring nostr and the primal client, i received some satoshis from other users (i erased the names), it's not much, but it's the principle that's beautiful.

for those who aren't yet familiar, primal is a decentralized social networking platform, mostly frequented by bitcoiners but open to everyone.

as on traditional social networks, you like, comment, and share, but there's an additional option that will definitely interest r/bitcoin members: the ability to donate satoshis via the lightning network ⚡

on nostr, it's called zap. you can choose to use your lightning address or create a wallet on your client.

then, users will decide whether or not to donate satoshis, depending on the quality of your posts, comments, etc., and you have the same option. if you like a piece of content or want to support a creator, don't worry, you can support them directly by donating some satoshis.

in short, if you are here it is because you are interested in bitcoin and you are in the right place, on the other hand if outside of reddit you are active on facebook, instagram, x, etc... you are perhaps wasting your time (unless you have thousands of subscribers and you generate an income), join nostr, test it and start if it is not already the case to benefit from the lightning network ⚡",https://i.redd.it/6rdvbm35qohf1.jpeg,16,2,1mkg02i,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9949,117463.47451085236

2025-08-08 08:09:16,"ethereum nears $4,000! is a new ath coming? ethereum has been on fire in the past 24 hours, gaining +5.88% and trading at 3,919 usd. the real story isn’t just the price, it’s the 42.9b trading volume, up more than 64% in a single day. that kind of liquidity spike often signals major moves ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/mkot8if77rhf1.png?width=2398&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab4b10daad937fbd45fabc3aac130c5e15d9770d

the 4,000 mark is more than just a round number. it’s a psychological barrier for traders and a technical resistance level that has stopped eth multiple times in the past. break it with volume, and we could see momentum carry eth toward its previous ath and maybe beyond. fail to hold above 4k, and we might witness a sharp correction as over-leveraged positions unwind.

the current setup feels eerily similar to historical pre-breakout phases, where consolidation near a key level led to explosive upside. but the risk of a “fakeout” remains, especially if macro conditions or bitcoin price action turn against the market.

2025-08-08 09:47:38,"word-of-mouth bitcoin social phenomenon i see a lot of posts about people damaging or losing relationships due to bitcoin conversations.  often times it seems people try to ""orange pill"" their friends and often times it doesn't work.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

unlike fiat, it doesn’t ask for approval. 
unlike gold, it doesn’t need physical custody. and unlike banks, it doesn’t care where you live or what passport you hold.

for once, the government couldn’t gatekeep the rails of money.
no censorship. no freezing. no printing.

just code, consensus, and community.

people would also probably find it hard to believe that semi-casual space travel would be a thing.

2025-08-09 04:10:21,"softwar: this book about bitcoin blew me away i recommended this book when i only started it to few crypto friends and now that i finished it (and i’m completely blow away by it’s potential
implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

2025-08-09 12:48:56,"question on bitcoin’s long-term security model i recently watched a video (will share in a comment) where the presenter made an interesting point: blockchains have to choose between *certainty of supply* and *certainty of security*. his argument was that a fixed supply means miner incentives could weaken over time, which could impact security. the alternative model he described was one where supply isn’t absolutely capped, but security is always reliably funded — and any supply growth could be offset by network usage (through mechanisms like fee burns).

i’m wondering what the bitcoin community thinks about this. is the current plan — relying on transaction fees alone — the best long-term approach for security, or do you see potential challenges?

i’m not trying to push another coin here, just curious to hear solid counterpoints from people who understand bitcoin’s security model inside and out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlomkj/question_on_bitcoins_longterm_security_model/,0,7,1mlomkj,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9806,116510.08393213755

i’m not sure i even want to “get to the end of this mystery” as it keeps him alive in my own way. on the flip side, what he may have had could be worth a notable sum today. 

if anyone has any ideas i’d love to hear and can share some of the details of the mystery as it unfolds. passwords? that would be another story. he would make his girlfriend’s name and some date converted into binary code, sometimes backwards. so even if we find it we may never know if there is anything in it. 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mlpj8d/laptop_with_bitcoin/,71,102,1mlpj8d,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.8883,116510.08393213755

for perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth 

$1,050,000,000,000,000

a quadrillion?

that’s crazy talk. hopefully. but that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

rough esitmates say there’s only 2.4 billion us dollars - everything else is made up imaginary dollars and debt.

but if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it’s 50,000 times higher

and if there’s a sliding scale 

so that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

ridiculous.

i say all of that to say - as many of you know - bitcoin can’t be equated to dollars

some might say this chart has no significance. but i disagree. remember when everyone on this sub was mega bearish on eth back in april....well we saw eth/btc hit key support levels and now a rapid v-shape recovery. this wasn't a coincidence:

**genius act**

·         **guiding and establishing national innovation for u.s. stablecoins**

·         **the first ever framework for stablecoin regulations**

·         **1:1 reserves required for united states $ dollar assets (hell yes, hopefully they audit usdt though lol)**

·         **the bank secrecy act now covers providers of stablecoin yasssss**

**clarity act**

·         **definition outlined for sftc and sec oversight of cryptocurrency**

·         **provides clarity for which digital assets are a commodity versus a security**

·         **trading platforms need to provide disclosure agreements or rules and to custody crypto**

**anti-cbdc surveillance state act**

* **federal reserve may not launch a cbdc central bank digital currency**
* **helps safeguard financial privacy and overreach by the government**

**these 3 bills provide a major shift of cryptocurrency from suspicion to adoption. yes, we always talk about mass adoption and here we are folks, the future of cryptocurrency 1 step at a time!**

**now it’s been a few weeks since crypto week and since the bills have passed. how are the effects of crypto week thus far?**

**cryptocurrency markets surging! ethereum headed towards ath with bitcoin maintaining structure. institutions are heavily investing in cryptocurrencies and stablecoins! operation choke point 2.0 has halted, allowing cryptocurrency services to access services provided by banks. regulators are working with banks to define rules for stablecoin creation and custody! executive order was signed by willy wonka to let cryptocurrency be investable through 401k plans, super awesome! irs is trying to make the tax process for cryptocurrency simpler, hopefully no more having to use services to go through all of my transactions each year haha.**

is this bad for me on my health since i won’t be going out enjoying anything or will future me be happy with myself ?? any help kinda stuck on this.

edit: thank you for everyone’s advice means a lot🙏 you guys say to go out and enjoy since it’s my early 20s but i’ve always had the mentality of work  your self now the most possible and you’ll be rewarded in the future(30s) not sure if that’s bad mentality? as for my friends again another example today they invited me to a bbq but i decided not to go after making this post. currently they are drinking, smoking the green, and more unnecessary amount of food. you guys say to enjoy myself being more out with them but those things don’t me feel happy about nothing just makes me feel i’m wasting time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mm8tnz/is_this_bad_for_me_in_the_long_run/,82,72,1mm8tnz,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9773,116510.08393213755

2025-08-10 06:10:33,"binance index linked, dca strategy and investment diversification does anyone use the binance index linked dca strategy? is it wise to invest this way, or do you have a better suggestion?

i have been investing since the beginning of 2024, the same amount in dollars every week. so far, i have only increased the amount i invest once.

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.
how should i best allocate the money? where should i open accounts? which platforms do you use and why? is it better to have everything in one place, or split between multiple brokers/platforms?

now the question is, if i send part of that btc to another wallet not owned by me (example: if i use a non-kyc peer to peer website to sell the btc to a random person and get euros on my bank account or in my paypal account) (always amounts of less than 1.000€ to try not to trigger any alarm on the banks/paypal), am i safe in term of taxes and traceability?

or do i have to make a more elaborated planning to make the btc more ""invisible"" to the government?

and another case: can i send 50% of that btc back to the exchange to sell it with kyc, paying taxes, and the other 50% of that btc send it to a seller peer-to-peer? always with <1.000€ transfers to try to not ring any alarm?

i come to you, we meet somewhere safe and public (airport lounge, coffee shop, library, etc.), and i do the recovery right there with you watching the whole process. no mailing drives off to a stranger, no “trust me bro” remote access sessions you see exactly what’s happening start to finish.

2025-08-10 19:56:01,"bitcoin, debt & gdp i have been paying attention to ray dalio for a few years about debt.  specifically:  dalio describes the us as approaching a “debt death spiral,” where the government must borrow more to service existing debt, accelerating the problem. he warns that if buyers, particularly foreign investors, lose confidence and stop purchasing us bonds, this could lead to a crisis with higher interest rates and borrowing costs, potentially overwhelming the economy

i’ve also been paying attention to warren’s comments about debt to gdp…specifically:   buffett described the current us fiscal deficit as “unsustainable over a very long period of time” and warned that “it has the aspect to it that gets uncontrollable at a certain point.”

that said, with the rise of ai in every aspect of every business, gdp will likely rise significantly.

2025-08-10 21:32:07,"owning btc equivalent to owning shares of an oil company 150 years ago? like most, bitcoin is hard to wrap your mind around initially. is it a commodity? a financial asset? property? (edit: i believe that this is a monetary system.) how in a world of inflationary currencies does a deflationary monetary system behave? people are saying its price is already too high. today’s 118k price is scary high, especially if you’re used to traditional finance and are used to stocks being in the double or even tripple digits. many are not even aware you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin. so don’t look at the price, look at its potential, then compare that to the potential of any other asset you can think of. i couldn’t find one, unless you look back in history… lately i have been comparing bitcoin to oil as far as its influence in the markets over time. 

today oil is a relatively stable commodity. people trade it and it’s relatively predictable with some upsets here and there, but a barrel of oil can be bought at the same price it was 20 years ago. so when will bitcoin reach that stable point and what will its price be? no idea. some say parity with gold markets, some say its potential will reach far beyond that. but until it reaches that stabilization point, i propose we are in the early oil boom period.

these are my musings lately, so please indulge me and let me know if i’m on track or not:

most consider oil to be a mature commodity and is one of the 11 major global market sectors. (energy sector, gics). oil took a long time (over 150 years) to reach its full potential, which seems to be recent years. new oil reserves are often left untapped due to development expense and there is relative balance in the market and price stability with some exceptions. 

up to a couple decades ago we were fighting wars over oil due to scarcely.

before that, companies over the globe were fighting to secure oil resources and investing monstrous resources to extract it. these companies (exxon, bp, etc…) were truly reaping the benefits.

before that, in the early 20th century, companies were gobbling up smaller producers, their monopolies posed problems to the point where the government broke up those companies, at least for standard oil in the us. this was the time when the famous rockefeller family came to power.

in the late 1800s oil was a smaller endeavor, with even individual people or families being able to break into the industry if they owned the right plot of land.

the very beginning (1850’s) it was mostly a few eccentric people experimenting with this new resource that bubbled to the surface and trying to invent uses for it.

if you compare bitcoin to this, where do we fall? we are not at the beginning experimental stage. that was for satoshi and the early adopters before it had much monetary value.  i would argue that we are comparable to the late 1800s period, where individuals and small companies can easily get into the market and we are well before the early 20th century monopolies. just think what it would mean to your family if they had even a small piece of an oil company from the late 1800s.

we are all very early.

2025-08-10 22:21:02,"been burned by my 403(b), borrowed to buy btc — thinking of taking another 0% loan to buy more. looking for honest, practical perspectives (especially things i haven’t heard from ai) hey all — long post, but i want to be clear and practical about where i’m coming from and what i’m considering. i’ve done a lot of reading and talked to ai, and now i want real human experience and perspectives.

short backstory (the facts):
• i contributed to my school district’s 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory — terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn’t appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
• i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there’s a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1–2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
• separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that’s being paid down aggressively.
• now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i’m seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i’d put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
• i’ve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don’t gamble, pay down debt, don’t lever into volatile assets. i get that. i’m asking this community for perspectives i haven’t considered — practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
• i believe in bitcoin’s long-term thesis — adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it’s likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
• i really don’t want to liquidate my existing btc position — emotionally and strategically i’d rather hold. that’s why i’m considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
• i’m disciplined on repayment timelines and i’m comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i’m trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you’d known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i’m considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this — how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says “don’t gamble.” i’m looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i’m curious about: partial loan → partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced — stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who’s been through a leveraged crypto move — how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
• i’m not asking whether crypto is risky — i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
• i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i’m trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
• i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you’re going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn’t, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i’ve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i’ll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i’ll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why — so others can learn from the outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mmvy3t/been_burned_by_my_403b_borrowed_to_buy_btc/,5,22,1mmvy3t,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9345,119266.92516880557

2025-08-11 00:57:18,"bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, but it doesn't actually matter. grow your conviction. i believe the subject of value is the most important talking point of all the “talking points” for those who object to bitcoin because if value is subjective then all the other points do not matter.

this post is more philosophical leaning, but i think it can provide og's, lurkers, and newbies with some conviction and a starting point to answer the above questions. (i find them to be the questions most brought up by skeptics)

questions i will refute are: “bitcoin has no intrinsic value”. “bitcoins value is unreliable and subjective”. 

first, what is *intrinsic value*? the word is first translated from the latin word intrinsecus. this word was not used very often, but in all contexts from ancient latin writings the word was translated into french and english as meaning *internally, inside, or within.* notable classic latin examples of intrinsic in ancient texts include cicero, and cato the elder.

a common anti-bitcoin talking point is to attack it from an angle of intrinsic value. there is no such thing as intrinsic value purely from a human perspective. the economist and historian, gary north writes, “*it is not value that is intrinsic to gold, but only the physical prop­erties that are valued by acting men.”*[ *https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/*](https://fee.org/articles/the-fallacy-of-intrinsic-value/) this is a good commentary on the fallacy of “intrinsic value”

in other words, all value humans make judgements on rely on humans actually existing. if humans did not exist, then bitcoin would have no intrinsic value to humans. if humans did not exist nothing would have intrinsic value to humans.

this argument is poor reasoning against bitcoin, because it can be applied to everything else humans place value on. all value humans assign is subjective, simply because it relies on them existing. 

james hanley eloquently writes, ""the idea of intrinsic value is, one might say, intrinsically appealing. it feels right. but it is wrong. the valuation of any unit of anything desired varies both from individual to individual and moment to moment. and it is only that subjective valuation that makes mutual gains from exchange possible.”[ https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/all-value-is-subjective-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

if you remove your biases, you will realize that everything we value is subjective. other people can find value in things that you don't find valuable, and that's ok. 

the words ""intrinsic"" and “value” existed long before economists such as richard cantillon ( the father of modern economics) and adam smith first started using the terms from an economist's perspective. the argument that using, “the philosophical definition is wrong and it’s not what intrinsic value means” is flat out wrong. all economists that used these terms first understood them from a philosophical perspective, even though there is some disagreement.

here is an argument i use to justify why nothing has “intrinsic value”. this is an argument that i personally formulated. there may be good objections to it, but i consider it pretty strong. (this argument is purely from a human perspective. i know of 1 good objection to it, but it relies on other *a priori* conditions that are irrelevant to this sub)

i will define terms here so there is no confusion. 

1. “subject” - any being or living thing.
2. “value judgement” - assignment of importance, worth, preference or utility, made by a subject

argument:

1. a value judgment is an assignment of importance, worth, preference, or utility made by a subject. (this is a definitional claim) 
2. in all observed cases, value judgments arise from subjects with preferences, desires, or goals. (this is an empirical observation, not a metaphysical assumption.) 
3. there is no known instance of value being assigned in the absence of a subject capable of making such judgments. (an epistemic point, not yet claiming value cannot exist independently — just that we’ve never seen it happen.) 
4. therefore, it is reasonable to infer that value judgments are dependent on the existence of valuing subjects. 
5. if value only arises through the act of being judged or assigned by a subject, then value does not exist independently of subjects. 
6. therefore, all value is subjective.
7. therefore, using the statement, ""bitcoin has no intrinsic value"" as an argument against bitcoin is poor reasoning since it can be applied to anything else humans place value on.

everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve.

stay humble.

2025-08-11 08:57:44,"how to take profits like a pro during the upcoming crypto run. there are roughly 4 phases during the bull run. they might overlap with each other for a while.

1. btc pumps, the rest just sucks ft. eth. any coin vs. btc (pair) is tanking, nobody is excited except the btc maxis cause 99% degens on this sub own alts.
2. eth wakes up (+- current situation) and we have a gigantic volatility on eth/btc chart, money moves between those 2 + some major alts. eth folks, after being ridiculed for year(s) with btc/eth charts, start to get some confidence and we get the classical flippening yelling. eth is gonna flip/overtake btc (which of course will never happen)
3. eth season is done and we have a situation where money flows from eth into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). there will be several cycles, not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump. alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping.
4. finally, once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

the latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into btc again. the alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ath (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

you also don't keep all of your converted btc when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for fiat (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. you can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 10-20% apy while your fiat gets you close to zero apy when you move it to your bankster's place.

once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy btc again because nobody is buying btc at atl except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top = ath hopefully) and finally 25% that's left for one last profit taking.

basically, you sell gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto and sell heavily +- 50% of your bag when you feel that this is gonna be as good as it gets (you'll never get the top so anything close to it = before and/or after ath is great).

i'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. ok, bye.

2025-08-11 12:45:54,"what would happen hello, this is a legitimate question for the community, so here it is. if the majority of money that has been dumped into bit coin is usd, i'm just going to make up a number 70 percent (tried to research the actual number but couldnt find any data). 

now let's say the us dollar collapses because they can no longer service their national debt.  let's say the us dollar is worth 1/10th of what it usually is. 

would this also drop bitcoin by almost the same amount considering how much investment was made originally in usd? or does bitcoin price stay the same because once the coin is bought it doesnt have a direct relationship to the currency it was purchased with?

on one hand it could be treated as it's own commodity and could retain its value on the world market, it would just cost 10 times more usd to buy a coin. 

but on the other hand if people started cashing out their bitcoin into usd theoretically the ""stockpile"" of usd that went into it wouldnt be enough to service all the people who wanted to cash out.

would love to hear peoples insight on what they believe would happen, or maybe you actually know how it all works and there is a finite answer.

passkey:

when my wallet software on my computer give me a receiving passkey, is that my private key or is that public?  it's the one i copy into my account on the exchange to send it, then tap my device to confirm it's the right passkey.  i'm assuming this is my private key.  is that correct?  

seedphrase:

let's say i lose my harward wallet and computer with the corresponding software and need my seedphrase to recover it.  what happens then?  would my seedphrase give me access to my private keys again?  where would i go to retrieve them because if i buy a new hardware wallet the first thing it does is give me a new seedphrase.

2025-08-11 13:37:46,"would you invest in post-quantum cryptos if they hit tier 1 exchanges? quantum computers are getting closer to breaking ecdsa, the lowest-hanging fruit in crypto security. if that happens, roughly 25% of bitcoin wallets could be at risk.

we don’t know exactly when a powerful enough quantum computer will be built, but it’s clear that it will happen sooner or later. most current blockchains, including bitcoin and ethereum, would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. efforts are underway to upgrade these blockchains, but it’s a challenging process that will take time — and there’s no guarantee the fixes will be ready before the threat becomes real.

it’s worth noting that there are already post-quantum cryptocurrencies designed to withstand this risk from the start. they use quantum-safe signature schemes like xmss or sphincs+, which cannot be broken by shor’s algorithm. a few of these coins are live today, but most are only available on small, niche exchanges with low liquidity.  


**questions for you:**

1. should quantum-resistant cryptos be listed on tier 1 exchanges like binance, coinbase, or kraken?   
a) yes  
b) no

2. after such a listing, i would:  
a) stick to mainstream crypto only, so no impact to me.  
b) add quantum-resistant crypto to my portfolio as a hedge against a black swan event.  
c) focus only on holding a post-quantum crypto portfolio.  
d) no impact to me, as i already own some from a smaller exchange.

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

while researching this, i came across [an article that outlines a couple of alternative buying strategies](https://threedolar.com.br/en/complete-guide-bitcoin-investment/) that could be interesting for timing buys, which got me thinking.

i feel secure with my emergency fund in place, but i'm also aware that deviating from simple dca introduces more risk and potential for mistakes.

for those of you who are past the initial emergency-fund-building phase:

* what did you do with the cash flow that used to go into savings? did you keep saving or did you increase your investment rate?
* what are your thoughts on using non-dca strategies to try and optimize entries? does anyone here do something similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mnuj6g/beyond_dca_ive_hit_my_6month_emergency_fund_goal/,18,18,1mnuj6g,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.841,118773.79960860992

2025-08-12 05:49:16,"us might “print” $900b without selling a single ounce of gold – and btc could be the biggest winner global finance is getting shaky again. traditional tools are losing their punch, and now the us is openly talking about a move straight out of the history books — **gold monetization**.

here’s the play:

* the us holds **261.5m ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices 🤯).
* market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.
* if revalued, treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the fed, instantly crediting **\~$900b** without selling a single bar.
* no new debt, just… magic money backed by gold.

it’s been done before:

* **1933:** fdr confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.
* **1971–73:** nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, treasury revalued, pocketed \~$800m without selling gold.

why now?

* fed’s own memo (aug 1) points to other countries doing it — germany, italy, lebanon, south africa.
* analysts like luke gromen say revaluing to **$20k/oz** could free up **$5t**, slashing us debt-to-gdp from 122% → \~70%.
* trump’s treasury officials are hinting it’s “on the table.”

the crypto twist:

* last year, sen. cynthia lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy bitcoin** for a us strategic reserve — “budget-neutral.”
* trump’s crypto advisor called it “the best way” to get btc without taxing americans.

why this matters for bitcoin:

1. if fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets — gold *and* btc.
2. state-level btc accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.
3. but… big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.

bottom line:  
gold monetization might be sold as a “smart debt fix,” but it’s still stealth money printing. if it happens, we could see:

* **short-term:** btc moon fuel 🚀
* **long-term:** a fight for btc’s soul — decentralized freedom vs. state-controlled asset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mo0lch/us_might_print_900b_without_selling_a_single/,139,58,1mo0lch,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9578,118773.79960860992

2025-08-12 06:18:24,"stop the government taking a cut if you actually believe in free markets, monero isn’t optional, it’s a tool.

everyone loves to talk about “financial freedom” and “free markets” but most of you are still sitting with coins on exchanges, doing your taxes and trusting the same government you say you hate.

if you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, monero is how you actually do it.

so you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it’s now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. they took zero risk in that trade. when banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. when you win, they take a cut. when you lose, they vanish.

monero fixes that. nobody knows your 50 bucks of btc turned into 2k if you swap through monero. no blockchain trail, no reporting, no “oops, i forgot to declare my gains” with your name all over a public ledger.

and for those who support drug legalization… you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren’t using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you’re just talking. monero enables that market today.

when talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. they'll say “oh it’s only a small percent of the volume” or “fiat is worse.” screw that. the answer should be “fuck yes it’s used for this, that’s the point” and “fuck taxes, fuck government overreach” and “what does your shitcoin do for the average person?”

we took the risk with crypto, it could have gone to zero. the government didn’t take the risk, so they don’t deserve a reward. they’ll never bail us out, so why are we letting them cash in when we win?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mo1345/stop_the_government_taking_a_cut/,4,73,1mo1345,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.168,118773.79960860992

last week, as markets were down across the board after the tariff and job number scares, we had this to say about btc:

*the breakout has not been invalidated, and the price target remains at $142k. so with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.*

*let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s tariff news. but for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.*

and well, that did indeed turn out to be the right call. stocks bounced back. bitcoin bounced back.

there is some us inflation data coming in this week, so we’ll keep an eye on that. but for now, there is still nothing bearish about the weekly bitcoin chart, and the most likely path is up from here.

not because i wanted to “beat the market”, but because i was tired of:

* forgetting to make my buys on time
* buying emotionally during pumps
* getting bored during sideways and forgetting to buy (again)

what started as a weekend project has turned into something much bigger: a fully working multi-exchange dca bot that supports both **fixed** and **multiplier** strategies, backtest, and risk modeling.

along the way, i learned a ton — not just about code, but about:

* how different exchanges handle api limits (and how frustratingly inconsistent they are)
* why small order sizes can cause more trouble than large ones
* the psychological side: most people want to “set and forget,” but they still check every day
* why back-testing results can look amazing on paper… but live trading always teaches you new lessons

i’m sharing this because i think a lot of devs and traders have thought about building something similar but the rabbit hole is deeper than it looks. lets connect!

if anyone’s interested, i can dive deeper into:

* how multiplier dca actually works in practice

2025-08-12 14:45:33,"decline of fiat currency and bitcoin's ascent in a post-oil era recently, i have been reading a lot of books on climate change and the depletion of natural resources worldwide. ""the limits to growth"" by donella meadows inspired me a theory that i would like to share.

as you are likely aware, our entire civilization is built on fossil energy sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas. the issue is that these resources are finite and are diminishing daily as the global population and our consumption continue to grow. while it is theoretically possible to discover new deposits, the remaining resources are harder to find and require more investment to extract, making them more expensive.

(by the way, i live in france, so i will use france as an example, but this scenario could certainly apply to your country as well.)

currently, france imports 90% of the fossil energy it uses. let’s suppose there is less gasoline available, and the government decides to reserve a significant portion for defense, the military, and hospitals. this could lead to shortages at many gas stations and a rise in prices.

people might struggle to commute to work due to high costs, and food delivery to shops and restaurants could become expensive or even impossible. maintaining roads would require a substantial amount of money. food prices could skyrocket. essentially, every aspect of our society would be affected and could begin to crumble.

with the job market being broken and many people employed in low-wage jobs that depend directly on gasoline, widespread layoffs could occur. combined with significant inflation, france (and europe) might end up experiencing hyperinflation.

since many people already struggle to make ends meet, i don’t want to imagine what it could be like. especially given france’s reputation for *la révolution.*

at this point, many people could lose faith in the euro and seek a new store of value. gold might make a comeback, but not everyone can afford it, and it comes with several inconveniences that you are probably familiar with. consequently, people might turn to bitcoin.

so, my take is that hyperbitcoinization will take place, not because of technology, not because of any ceo or political figure, but because of hyperinflation due to fossil energy shortages.

and here i’m only talking about fossil energy shortages. earth has 9 global boundaries, 6 of them are exceeded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1moaozn/decline_of_fiat_currency_and_bitcoins_ascent_in_a/,0,2,1moaozn,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9432,120202.53485503166

2025-08-12 15:04:03,"how to easily integrate bitcoin payments & donations into your web app — a step-by-step guide for the crypto community hey everyone!

i’ve been working on a simple demo app that shows how you can integrate bitcoin payments and donations directly into your web application using btcpay server: [**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

the goal here is to share knowledge and bring value to our community by making it easier for developers and enthusiasts to accept crypto payments securely and efficiently: 

if you’re curious about how this works, the demo uses a public btcpay demo store to create invoices and track real-time payments via bitcoin or the lightning network. it’s a practical example with a backend in express.js and a frontend built in angular, showing everything from invoice creation to displaying payment status and even some ux touches.

i’ve put together a detailed tutorial that walks you through:

* setting up your btcpay demo store and generating api keys
* building frontend inputs for donation amounts and usernames
* calling your backend api to create invoices on btcpay server
* displaying invoice payment links and tracking payment status in real time

the main idea is to empower developers and crypto enthusiasts with the knowledge to integrate decentralized payment solutions seamlessly.

if you want to explore the demo or try it yourself, check out the live demo site here:  
[**https://btcpay.web.app/**](https://btcpay.web.app/)

with that said, the other day i was thinking about the future of bitcoin and was wondering if we’ll ever get to the point where our appliances begin to mine bitcoin. most major home appliances now have some sort of computer chip in them. why not have the chip mine bitcoin while it’s in use? for instance, you wash and dry a load of clothes. when the appliance turns on, it starts to mine btc. you turn the tv on, and it starts mining. this gives security to the bitcoin network, can help offset electricity costs to run the appliance, and more. appliances like the refrigerator could constantly mine. but smaller stuff like an oven or dishwasher would mine, then kick off when the user is finished with the appliance.

2025-08-13 12:27:46,"what is value and price, and why bitcoin’s price will keep rising we all know the words “value” and “price”, but what do they really mean, and what’s the difference between them? why are some things worth millions while others are worth nothing at all? what role do society, resources, time, and even culture play in shaping these concepts?

let’s start with definitions:

**value** – a subjective perception of the importance, usefulness, or significance of something. it’s the “why” behind why something matters or doesn’t.

**price** – a quantitative expression of value (usually in money), showing exactly how much something costs in numerical terms.

for example: the item with the highest value to a human – water – has a low price in most regions, while a useless memecoin has no real value at all but may sometimes carry a high price.

# types of price

price is a tool for measurement and exchange.

**exchange value** – the foundation of a market economy, showing how much other goods or money one can get for an item.  
example: 1 btc = 110,000 usd or 1 btc = 1,617 barrels of oil. in a market economy, exchange value is driven by market price, determined by supply and demand.

**imputed value** – the estimated value of a good or service based on expert calculation, analogy, or assumed usefulness rather than market mechanisms. used in government policy, ecosystem service evaluation, social policy, tender bids, and in valuing public goods where market-based pricing is impossible.

**cost price** – the sum of all actual expenses incurred to produce and deliver a product or service to the consumer. it includes raw materials, labor, equipment depreciation, rent, energy, taxes, and other costs. it defines the minimum price at which a product can be sold without incurring a loss.

**intrinsic value (fair value)** – a theoretically justified valuation of an asset, company, or project based on fundamentals: profits, cash flows, assets and liabilities, growth prospects, and market risks.  
example: an investor calculates that a company’s stock is worth $100, but it trades at $70. he concludes it’s an undervalued asset and buys.

# types of value

value is multidimensional and can be classified both by its source and by how it’s perceived.

**utilitarian value** – usefulness, ranging from life-essential (water, food, oxygen) to nearly useless (souvenirs) and even negative utility (harmful items like cigarettes). the price of highly useful goods depends on time and place. for example, a bottle of water is cheap almost everywhere, but in a desert emergency its price can skyrocket.

**emotional value** – tied to personal feelings or memories, such as a childhood toy or a gift from a loved one. for most people, such an item is worthless, but for one person, it can be priceless.

**cultural value** – connected to history, art, and tradition. this includes antiques, vintage items, and objects that represent important symbols (religious, national, etc.).

**social value** – what’s important in the eyes of others. these are status-signaling items like luxury watches, expensive cars, or limited-edition sneakers. often, the brand and scarcity are the main drivers of price.

**existential value** – things that cannot be expressed in monetary terms: freedom, life, love, worldview.

# factors affecting price

here are 15 key factors that shape the final price:

1. production costs (cost price)
2. rarity
3. supply and demand (plus liquidity)
4. competition
5. government regulation
6. logistics
7. technological level
8. brand and image
9. marketing and packaging
10. consumer psychology
11. traditions and culture
12. currency exchange rates
13. inflation
14. financial bubbles
15. geopolitics and crises

# why bitcoin’s price will rise

bitcoin is a completely new asset class. it’s not a commodity, stock, or bond, so traditional valuation methods like intrinsic value or fair value don’t apply.

what it does have: cost of production, average market price, trading volumes, and liquidity.

bitcoin through the 15 price factors:

1. cost price – driven by mining costs, mainly electricity and taxes. halving increases cost price over time.
2. rarity – supply limited to 21 million btc; decreasing over time due to lost keys.
3. supply and demand – 560m crypto holders, $10–20b spot volume, $40–60b with futures & etfs. etfs expand access.
4. competition – altcoins are not real competitors; the only rival is gold.
5. government regulation – u.s. acceptance is a global green light; states and companies now hold btc.
6. logistics – irrelevant except for transaction fees.
7. technology – debated, but simple, reliable, decentralized.
8. brand – bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency.
9. marketing – best ad is rising price.
10. consumer psychology – veblen effect boosts demand.
11. traditions & culture – btc is culturally neutral.
12. currencies – correlated with usd.
13. inflation – makes btc attractive, especially in high-inflation countries.
14. bubbles – bitcoin thrives in speculative growth cycles.
15. geopolitics – potential to behave like gold in crises.

# conclusion

bitcoin is almost the perfect asset for price growth, as it checks nearly all key factors driving value higher. the only serious threats are mining pool collusion (51% attack) and quantum computing, both unlikely in the near term. other risks may cause short-term drops but aren’t existential.

2025-08-13 14:10:14,"btc’s bullish momentum might be far from over bitcoin has been on a tear lately, smashing through resistance levels and holding its ground like it owns the market. what’s interesting is this rally doesn’t feel like the quick, overheated pumps we’ve seen before, it feels more controlled, backed by strong market participation and real buying pressure.

zooming out, we’re still in a clear uptrend: higher highs, higher lows, and a strong foundation of demand building at each consolidation zone. etfs are steadily pulling in new capital, on-chain data is showing increased accumulation from both retail traders and institutional wallets, and liquidity is starting to flow back into the crypto market.

even with the price already up significantly, the structure looks healthy. the retracements have been shallow, volume remains strong, and sentiment, while improving, hasn’t yet reached the kind of euphoric peak that usually signals a top.

add in the macro picture, cooling inflation numbers, rate cut expectations, and a growing appetite for risk assets and you’ve got the perfect recipe for continued upside.

if you get oversold price action that crashes into oblivion, then when the market recovers and is well gain, you can get insane over-buying as a natural reaction. kind of like ""for every action, there is an opposite reaction"".

then the insane melt-up crashes back down. rinse and repeat.

every cycle has had its final months go into a fomo run, then a mania melt-up into parabolic price action.

# where are we so far?

it's hard to say yet. we could be somewhere in between these two sides of the spectrum:

1- we could be on the very flatline before a major parabolic melt-up that will dwarf all this year's price action.

2- or this could be a milder melt-up like 2021, and we could be already more than halfway into a milder parabolic run.

# what perfect storm of events could help fuel a melt-up?

**-fear desensitization: heavy market fear for over a year, but with no consequences as the price still gets new aths:**

first off, it always helps when the market has already had most of its major fear out of the way.

and it might even have been increasingly desensitized from fear.

the market has already gone through months in recent years of fears of threats of nuclear war, major recession, tariff wars, covid variants, economic trouble all around the world, along with monthly crypto fud we had for over a year, from the crypto banking collapse to the recent xmr fear of a 51% attack. it's been one after another.

there's been an overload of fear, now mostly blown over, that will make it difficult to out-do.

it might even turn into a boy who cried wolf situation, even if there is legitimate fear coming up.

especially now that people see that despite all the fear we had, it didn't stop bitcoin from going past $120k.

**-m1 m2 money supply** has been climbing more sharply, and is forecast to continue this trend. while bitcoin has been falling behind. this is probably the trend that the crypto market has loved following the most, historically.

**-fed rate cuts.**

fed cuts haven't even started yet. it's unlikely we have even seen the biggest gains yet without any cuts started.

**- crypto etfs, 401ks, sovereign funds, coporate funds, etc...**

2025-08-13 16:27:36,"my co-workers are using the term ""altcoins"" at lunch yes, i'm tagging this as anecdotal.

i've been in crypto since the 2020 crash and subsequent market boom in 2021. last time around, as crypto was heating up, there was a noted rise in public comment: an nfl player requesting his salary in bitcoin instead of dollars, bitcoin purchase stations being added to us gas stations, and even that goddamn superbowl commercial.

it was a time for trotting out a longtime crypto concept: everyone feels like a genius in the boom times.

once bitcoin got mentioned on my dad's local news station, even he started talking about it, and how his (elderly) neighbors were all aware that it was a crazy scam.

the real sign of the times, though, was when my co-workers decided to start talking about bitcoin and their ""altcoin portfolios"" at lunch. mind you: these are people who don't own stocks, laughed at me when i told them i used our company's 401-k matching offer, and let multiple people know that their ultimate retirement plan is to win a couple of big scratch-off lottery tickets. (you know, because if they buy a few every week for life, they're ""guaranteed"" to win a big one or two.)

then the bubble burst and my co-workers all shut the hell up about crypto except for one who admitted their paper hands folding. (i suspect all of them traded at a loss instead of waiting 5 years for this run-up.)

anyway, the circle is becoming complete again: my co-worker lunch table is talking loudly about doge and other altcoins and how they're going to get vacation homes soon.

you know the rest, cryptofam: if you've been dcaing since the 2021 crash, we're back into the public talking phase. will the bigger fireworks go off? bitcoin hitting 122k was a big damn firework, for sure, but will we see something more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mp957l/my_coworkers_are_using_the_term_altcoins_at_lunch/,72,35,1mp957l,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,-0.7615,123560.99363577303

2025-08-13 17:40:10,"bag the real prize *by leibish polnauer & diana jarrett*

  
sotheby’s fashion icon auction closed on july 10, 2025, selling a preowned handbag dating to 1985 for us $10.1 million. like rare automobiles, say a mclaren f1 valued at us $23 million for instance, one never says ‘used’ referring to such items. they are always preowned.

 the birkin bag craze

  
the current birkin bag mania, which pinnacled in an eye-watering us $10 million dollar hammer price recently is even more poignant after seeing the wear-and-tear on this 40 year old handbag. obviously it’s been used, a lot.

while we are witnessing soaring resale prices for couture handbags at auction lately, this bag is singularly unique. created by hermès for its namesake, 1960-70s actress jane birkin, it possesses a special cachet because of the history behind its creation and her owning it. still  it is a very rough looking handbag better suited for a memorabilia display than actually being worn today. this is likely its destiny.

  
even jane birkin became disenchanted with the whole birkin bag thing at some point, suggesting that her name be removed from the now iconic hermès style.

 how to spend on luxuries 

considering all the ways one could invest in accessories, is a birkin bag the best way to spend your profits from cryptocurrency growth? or would an intense pink diamond, for instance, be a wiser and more glamourous choice?

  
examining the phenomenon for unlikely over-the-top prices on these soft goods, business of fashion (june 24,2025) headlined, why jewellery feels like a better deal than a handbag. the article went on to state, “jewellery brands have raised prices less than fashion labels and now benefit from a stronger sense of lasting value.”

# diamonds are a single harvest 

astute observation, and it begs asking, what is ultimately more rare and valuable? couture fashion can always be replicated---absent the celebrity connection, of course. but fancy color diamonds? this is one harvest and done. once the earth gives up these rarities, that’s it.

# bitcoin benefits

not “like” electricity… but behaving *as* electricity in an engineering sense:

* **btc = electrons** — the indivisible carriers of economic energy.
* **proof-of-work = voltage source** — the push that drives the current.
* **miners = generators** — converting real-world energy into unforgeable monetary signal.
* **financial instruments (like mstr’s capital stack) = circuit components** — switches, resistors, capacitors, magnetic fields… each shaping or routing the bitcoin current in a unique way.

once you see bitcoin as the *signal*, not the powered device, the whole ecosystem makes more sense. it’s not a stock, not a company — it’s the base layer of a new monetary grid.

current price at time of post is $4,716

24-hour change is +9.75%

market cap is $567.7 billion

trading volume is $67.7 billion

circulating supply is 120.7 million ether

there are many key factors driving the price action such as institutional purchases of ethereum as retail is starting to sell.

https://preview.redd.it/kgkmm3viyvif1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=38891255d919b0a53e9fc7028f7234145fcaa6cc

ethereum etfs have seen more than $2.3 billion in inflows the last week, which is much more aggressive than bitcoin etfs in that time period!

network activity is booming currently with nearly 1.87 million transactions daily and increased nft activity on the blockchain.

total value locked (tvl) is $95 billion with eth having more than 61% of the share!

but most importantly, i feel the upgrades have had an immense impact in the price action such as eip-1559 that improved the efficiency of the network and brought in fee burning to decrease the inflationary pressures we saw.

finbold models target ethereum price range of $5,607 \~ $5,250 by august 31^(st)!

# technical analysis

macd – 5 green bars in a row, bullish crossing

rsi >70 – overbought and trending up

volume – new record for ethereum etf inflows ($1.5 billion within 2 days)

**ascending triangle** breakout and golden cross initiated.

btc liquidity is moving to eth, identified by increasing eth/btc ratio!

breakout post resistance of previous ath of $4,867.

target price is $5,200 based on the fibonacci extension.

bullish catalysts include etf inflows continuing, institutional and retail accumulation, and increase scaling and adoption!



**price range:      $4,200 ───── $4,700 ───── $4,868 ───── $5,200**

**support zones:    ↑ $3,887     ↑ $4,232**

**resistance zones:                ↑ $4,868 (ath)**

macd & rsi at rock bottom. on the weekly timeframe, both indicators are sitting in some of the lowest zones we’ve seen in ages. historically, that’s been a strong reversal signal.

stablecoin legislation in the us. new laws and regulatory clarity could push issuers to mint more stablecoins. more stables = more liquidity flowing into the market.

trump’s pension fund bill. allows us retirement funds to allocate to crypto. that’s a whole new class of institutional money.

etf momentum beyond btc & eth. we’re seeing a wave of altcoin etf filings, and big firms are starting to position themselves around alts, not just bitcoin.

google search spikes. “altcoin” and “ethereum” searches are at multi-year highs. retail attention is heating up.

cycle pattern. btc pumps first, then eth, then the alts. we’re right in that middle stage now.

what other arguments do you have for an imminent altseason?

(nasdaq: pfsa)**, a trailblazing digital health company revolutionizing continuous biochemistry monitoring, **has taken a bold step toward enhancing shareholder value with a strategic $100 million equity line of credit (eloc) from ascent partners fund llc**. announced on july 21, 2025, this innovative move positions profusa as a forward-thinking adopter of bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, aligning the company with a digital-first financial future.

the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin. **this strategy not only strengthens profusa’s balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company’s prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa’s commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.** this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa’s leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa’s bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time. 

  
i plan on mainly hodling, with possibly making 1-2 trades every few years if i feel like playing with the cycles.

right now, we’re seeing a familiar pattern: btc and eth surged, and now prices are starting to dip again. it’s the same story every cycle. new people jump in during the hype, the price goes up even more, and then reality sets in. those who over-invested or put in more than they can afford to lose become nervous, scared and highly reactive to negative change. a small drop in price occurs, and suddenly, the emotional chain reaction of sell-offs begins. huge drop in price incoming.

when this happens, just take a breath.

this kind of volatility is normal. what you’re seeing is weak hands getting shaken out. it’s not the end. it never is.

the best advice i can give: **zoom out**. look at the big picture. over any 2–3 year period in crypto history, if you held strong and didn’t try to trade every wave, you were likely rewarded. crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. it’s a long game.

so if you believe in the fundamentals of what you're investing in, **stay the course**. don’t let short-term noise wreck long-term gains.

2025-08-15 01:20:29,"why do people think their blockchains are fully on chain? **look into the blockchain you invest in.**  
do not just take the marketing material or a social media post at face value. take the time to understand how it works, where it runs, and who controls it. many people assume that because something is called a blockchain it is automatically fully on chain, but that is rarely the case. aside from value focused blockchains like bitcoin, and execution focused blockchains such as ethereum, the only major platform that runs everything including compute, storage, governance, and execution fully on chain is the internet computer protocol. most others are hybrids at best or partially centralized ledgers presented as blockchains.

when we talk about a blockchain being on chain we are talking about more than just recording transactions in a public ledger. it means the application logic, state changes, and data storage actually live on the blockchain itself where they are verifiable, tamperproof, and run without reliance on third party servers. in a true on chain model, everything from the code to the data is hosted and executed by the decentralized network. remove a node or even multiple nodes and the system continues running because no part of it depends on a single party’s infrastructure.

most blockchains do not operate this way. they run a consensus layer on chain to record transactions, but push the heavy lifting off chain. smart contracts often store pointers to data rather than the data itself. applications usually run their frontends and backends on centralized services like aws, google cloud, or other traditional hosting. even in networks with many validators, the core application stack can still be dependent on centralized infrastructure for hosting, computation, or indexing. if that off chain infrastructure goes down, the application breaks even if the ledger is still technically online.

this hybrid setup creates several problems. it weakens the tamperproof claim because if your backend logic or user interface is controlled by a single company it can be altered or shut down without consensus from the network. it increases the attack surface because hacks and exploits often occur when the off chain backend or bridge is compromised. these incidents are not blockchain ledger breaches but failures caused by centralized components that sit outside the chain.

we see this pattern repeatedly. the headlines about millions of dollars stolen from a protocol often trace back to a compromised front end, a faulty library, or an insecure key. the blockchain ledger itself remains untouched, but because the application logic lives off chain, an attacker can reroute funds or trick users into approving malicious transactions. these incidents happen because the system was never truly self contained on chain to begin with.

icp was built to avoid this problem entirely. its architecture allows developers to deploy canisters, which are smart contracts that can contain both code and data, directly to the blockchain. the frontend, backend, and database can all be hosted on chain and served directly from the network to the user’s browser without intermediaries. this removes the need for aws buckets, centralized backends, or hidden infrastructure dependencies. the code running your application is exactly what you can verify on the blockchain.

ethereum offers an open execution environment where smart contracts live on chain and run without central servers. however, because ethereum is expensive and slower for high volume storage and complex computation, many applications built on ethereum rely on off chain infrastructure for parts of their stack. this is a practical trade off, but it blurs the line between being on chain and being merely anchored to a blockchain.

value based blockchains like bitcoin operate differently. they focus entirely on securing the transfer of value and maintaining a censorship resistant ledger. they do not claim to run applications or host data on chain, so they avoid the mismatch between expectation and reality. their simplicity contributes to their security.

for other blockchains, the marketing often paints a picture of a fully decentralized self contained system when that is not the truth. the moment you realize that the application you use depends on a centralized backend you should also realize that the guarantees of decentralization and tamperproof operation no longer fully apply. this is why so many exploits are possible. attackers target the weak links, and in most so called blockchains, those weak links are off chain.

if you are investing in a project, understand the difference between a ledger on chain and a full application on chain. ledger only platforms can be fine for certain use cases, but they will never provide the same guarantees as a network where the entire stack, from smart contract logic to user facing code, is decentralized. icp proves that it is possible. the question is whether the others even want to try, because moving to a fully on chain architecture would require fundamentally rethinking their business models and governance structures.

until then, the next time someone claims their favorite blockchain is fully on chain, ask them where the application logic runs, where the data lives, and what happens if their chosen cloud provider shuts down for a week. if they cannot answer without naming a centralized service, you will know exactly how on chain it really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mqji9q/why_do_people_think_their_blockchains_are_fully/,24,95,1mqji9q,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.0971,118405.59579823952

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

2025-08-15 10:26:26,"if you had $80k dollars to deploy into crypto right now what would you buy and why? i've got about $77k usd in dry powder that i'm looking to deploy into crypto right now. given where the market stands today—with btc holding strong above $117k, dominance dipping and continuing to dip, and signs of rotation starting from btc to eth/large caps(this is already in full swing), then potentially down to mid caps and small caps/memes—what would you invest in if you had this amount lying around? 

why those picks specifically (e.g., utility, team, community, metrics like daas, profitability)?
also, keeping in mind the classic rotation thesis (money flows down the risk curve: btc first, then eth and large caps (we are seeing this already in full force), mids, and finally small caps/memes/degen plays), what would you buy now to position yourself for this and/or what would you rotate into over the next few months when alts start pumping? 

the narratives i think might do well are rwa, ai, depin, defi and obviously your l1's and l2's 

i do not want to buy things that have already pumped and would want to focus on allocating these funds to things that are yet to pump (some assymetric plays) i already hold a few coins just to name a few: btc, eth, xrp, arb, sui, sol, aptos, inj, avax, link, sei just to name a few

any thoughts on timing that shift based on btc dominance or other signals?

but otc doesn't mean unlimited supply. nor is it in a total vacuum.

those coins have to end up on those otc trader hands somehow.

the problem is a lot of these new whales and mega funds are hoarding btc and not planning on selling any time soon.

so that otc money is moving increasingly more in one direction, and not a lot is gonna come back to be sold.

what happens if these growing mega funds want to load up on more coins, but there isn't an otc seller available, or the sellers don't have enough coins?

they could increase the price, but if they increase it too much, it's gonna get buyers to go on exchanges.

otc traders are gonna have to fill some of those gaps somehow, and the next option is with coins from exchanges.

guarda – multi-crypto, staking features.

coinomirk support.

a lot of these new players aren’t just diversifying like tesla or coinbase. some are miners holding instead of selling, but a growing chunk are basically quasi-etfs whose whole business is piling up btc per share and even branching into eth or sol. 

they raise money with convertible bonds, which means if things go south they might have to dump coins to cover debt. that’s where the domino risk comes in. even if the first big debt maturities aren’t until 2029, a single panic sell could shake confidence and spark a chain reaction long before then.

i wanted some opinions/suggestions/assistance with a current crypto situation.

a guy i'm dating suggested this new coin. so i pumped almost $1500 into a ca and want to cash out or at least ""send"" it to myself on cashapp and cash it out to my bank account. 

the guy i'm seeing said i need to put another $500 into the ca in order for it to be able to swap or cash it out. but, based on what my base app is telling me, i just need some assets that are on the bnb network (same network as this new coin), and i can then swap it out to a ca of my choice, which would be the bitcoin wallet connected to my cashapp. 

the guy i'm dating originally told me after the first or second infusion of cash to the ca he sent me, that i would be able to withdraw. then it was ""okay, one more time and you should be able to cash out,"" but now he's saying it needs one more infusion of cash in order to make it be eligible to cash out!!!

and he's also saying that the ca is closing tomorrow and all the $ in my wallet will be worth nothing. it's of note that last weekend he also told me the ca was closing, but he said it was set to close ""on monday,"" as in this past monday, 4 days ago!!!

screenshot is  attached for reference. any information and/or resources you can point me to would be greatly appreciated!!! and, i specifically want to know the following:

1. is he just asking me to put more $ in so he can just take my $ for himself in his own ca/wallet and scamming me?
2. is this the normal for crypto? you have to put money in a ca then that ca account pushed money back to you? 
3. when a ca closes, does that truly render the funds in my wallet useless?
4. if it's not useless, can i do the following to get the $ to my bank account? 
    * buy another coin that's also on the bnb network to have it as an asset -> go to my wallet and ""send"" the funds to the ca -> connected to my cashapp crypto wallet -> cash out my cashapp crypto  wallet to my bank account connected to my cashapp
5. if the above is not the case, how should i go about trying to get the funds out of my wallet?? and is timing a factor for this (ie the ca ""closing"" and all that??

2025-08-16 03:54:53,"basic questions from a bitcoin newbie hey everyone,

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions—like fear and greed—that those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,5,22,1mrjzn5,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9955,117339.79190213275

2025-08-16 04:53:37,"bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction this essay compares and contrasts different authors from the mises institute alignment to an inquiry into mises own writing in regard to the concept known as mises regression theorem.  it re-visits a question that satoshi responded to about the nature of bitcoin and the possibilities of originations of the moneyness of considered objects:  
  
""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises’ axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn’t declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo’s work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,10,40,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176,117339.79190213275

i started investing 2 years ago, i'm mostly invested in blue chips canadian banks at this time, i also own some real estate and have a high paying job. i know this is probably boring and ''dumb'' compared to crypto investing to most of you.

crypto is a bit of my ''wildcard'' at this point, but i'm planning to put more and more into it over the next few years.

i literally only started looking into btc in the last few months, so you guys are much more well versed in the subject than i am.

which strategy would you go with?

a) 100% lumpsum into btc and any availible amount after that. let it simmer for 10+ years.  
b) dca btc daily

2025-08-16 15:40:31,"bitcoin vs nano: which is truly stronger against spam attacks? (2025 update) - **bitcoin vs nano: which is truly stronger against spam attacks? (2025 update)**


- **i've been diving deep into crypto spam resistance lately, especially after some frustrating ai chats that kept hyping bitcoin's ""unbeatable"" pow while downplaying nano's massive upgrades.**

- **with bitcoin still dealing with ordinals/runes spam and nano rolling out killer anti-spam features in v28.1, i thought it'd be helpful to lay out a full, evidence-based comparison.**

- **this isn't shilling  nano has its adoption hurdles, and bitcoin is king for a reason,but on pure spam defense? nano wins hands down in 2025.**

- **spam attacks here mean flooding networks with junk transactions to congest, bloat, or disrupt (e.g., ddos-style floods, dust attacks, or content embedding like nfts).**

- **i'll break it down by mechanics, recent issues, and why nano's feeless model isn't the weakness it's painted as.**

- **quick background:**

  - **bitcoin: proof-of-work (pow) blockchain with fees. miners prioritize high-fee tx; low-fee spam gets delayed/dropped. but segwit discounts (75% off witness data) enable cheap data spam.**

  - **nano: feeless block-lattice with open representative voting (orv). each tx requires sender pow; upgrades add prioritization and limits to thwart floods.**

- **key spam types and how each handles them:**

  - **transaction floods (pure spam):**

    - **bitcoin: fees deter during high demand (e.g., $10+ per tx in peaks), but cheap in lulls (1-5 sat/vbyte = <$0.01). mempool can bloat, delaying legit tx.**

    - **nano: dynamic pow (dpow) scales computational cost per tx. post-2021 upgrades (v22-v25) added prioritization buckets—spam gets deprioritized based on balance/activity. no monetary cost, but hardware-bound.**

  - **content/data spam (e.g., inscriptions, nfts):**

    - **bitcoin: big issue in 2025. ordinals/runes embed arbitrary data, bloating utxo set and nodes. exploits like ""gamified spam"" persist, with no core fixes—miners profit from fees.**

    - **nano: no equivalent; block-lattice doesn't allow easy data embedding. feeless but pow + filters prevent abuse.**

  - **dust attacks (tiny tx for tracking/bloat):**

    - **bitcoin: common; dust thresholds exist, but bypassed with minimal fees. utxo bloat strains wallets/nodes.**

    - **nano: account-chains make dust irrelevant; low-balance tx are low-priority and auto-dropped if spammy.**

  - **ddos/resource exhaustion:**

    - **bitcoin: nodes handle via mempool limits, but high-volume spam (e.g., 2015/2017 attacks) still spikes fees/node load.**

    - **nano: v28.1's bounded block backlog (bbb) caps unconfirmed tx at 100,000, preventing exhaustion. traffic shaping evens bandwidth, vote filters dedupe junk.**

- **2025 updates and recent issues:**

  - **bitcoin: no major anti-spam prs in core. ordinals/runes spam continues, with debates on ""design flaws"" (e.g., luke dashjr calls it exploitable). fees hit $305m weekly, partly from spam competition. hacks/phishing up, but that's not network spam.**

  - **nano: v28.1 (june 5, 2025) is a game-changer: bbb limits backlog, traffic shaping reduces congestion, vote filters cut bandwidth waste. no spam incidents since 2021—community calls it ""unspamable at scale."" rocksdb upgrades boost node stability.**

- **from older discussions (e.g., 2021 reddit thread on nano vs btc security), nano learned from attacks and evolved, while bitcoin's issues linger.**

- **head-to-head comparison :**

  - **aspect: primary defense**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): pow + fees: effective in bull markets but fails in lulls; low-fee data spam thrives (ordinals at 75% discount).**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): dpow + prioritization: computational cost scales; bbb (100k tx cap) and traffic shaping block floods consistently.**

  - **aspect: cost to attack**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): financial (high in peaks, low otherwise); nation-states could spam via printing.**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): computational (hardware-intensive); consistent barrier, no fee reliance.**

  - **aspect: recent spam events**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): ongoing ordinals/runes bloat; utxo growth from ""gamified"" spam; no 2025 fixes.**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): zero since 2021; v28.1 vote filters dedupe junk, enhancing efficiency.**

  - **aspect: user impact**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): fee spikes/delays during spam; node strain risks decentralization.**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): legit tx prioritized; no fees, instant confirms (0.35s avg).**

  - **aspect: efficiency metrics**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): energy-hungry (pow); 1-7 tx/s limit.**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): 16,100x faster, 8.5m times more efficient; scales without bloat.**

  - **aspect: weaknesses**

    - **bitcoin (2025 reality): open design invites abuse; hype overlooks content spam.**

    - **nano (2025 strengths): lower adoption; relies on reps (but decentralized via voting).**

- **verdict: nano is stronger against spam in 2025. its upgrades address feeless risks head-on, while bitcoin's fee market is inconsistent and doesn't stop data exploits. if you're in for fast, free tx without spam worries, nano shines. bitcoin's edge is ecosystem size/security via hashpower.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mrys1e/bitcoin_vs_nano_which_is_truly_stronger_against/,0,13,1mrys1e,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,-0.9959,117501.21653394958

2025-08-16 16:49:16,"a redbull fuelled breakdown of why i sleep better with my own keys. for those who saw my last post and now picture me as a redbull junkie with empty cans shaking for a third. it is not true but enjoy the thought as the real me is far less exciting. i drink it maybe twice a month when i feel like treating myself and sit out in my garden and drink it like it is some sort of rare vintage whilst i read the news thinking i look sophisticated enough to understand how the world actually works.

anyway, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how many people keep their bitcoin on exchanges and i'm on about considerable amounts because i know some of you will say ""no point self custodying if you only have £25 and a dream"", but lets be honest if you think that kind of bag is your key to an early retirement then please, treat yourself to a cold wallet and maybe a tattoo on your forehead that reads ""tell me to buy more bitcoin"". on a serious note, how many of you actually read the t&c's when signing up to an exchange? i didn't, but there will also be things that say:

""we reserve the right to suspend withdrawals""

""insolvency may result in partial or total loss of funds""

""in the event of catastrophic failure, we'll send you an automated email with the word ""unfortunately"" and picture of us sipping cocktails funded by everyone who lost their money""

we all know things like this has happened before which is why i'm hoping to at least give one person a sign to finally getting around to ordering that hardware wallet. i also find it a lot easier to hold on to my sats as its a whole ""thing"" to actually get around to liquidating. i do definitely sleep better knowing i'm the only person who has access to my funds and in that worst case scenario, global meltdown, we only need one bitcoiner to keep his node running and we can send some to the local prepper who is selling beans out of his garage.

so if you've got a hardware wallet sat in your shopping basket (the manufactures website of course) then see this as your sign to buy it, just make sure your keys are somewhere secure because its very easy to go half arsed with it at first but when your bag grows and your security doesnt, you're playing with fire.

i hate to sound old but just be sensible and maybe have a redbull just before unboxing ;).

i was hoping to do a poll but it didnt seem to let me as i was quite interested to se what the results would be. i hope this post was entertaining but if not it just gave me something to do on my saturday afternoon. if anyone has any questions about self custody then please just ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ms0p5y/a_redbull_fuelled_breakdown_of_why_i_sleep_better/,1,0,1ms0p5y,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9909,117501.21653394958

(https://x.com/soaker\_patoshi)

in the previous essay ([bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‐solution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1mrl65c/bitcoin_most_certainly_violates_mises_regression/)) we ended with statements by mises that his (austrian) school of thought ""praxeology"" rejects empirical (think archeological) based arguments and only accepts arguments extended from reason. 

here we will show countless examples of saifedean ammous, a purported austrian economics professor relying on empirical based points and arguments trying to make his conclusion about the economic implications of bitcoin. 

in this essay i use the perspective and intention of szabonian deconstruction, as well as our insights from doing the same with mises regression theorem, to highlight saifedean ammous’ nefarious use and wrapping of academic scholars work notably including mises, hayek, and nash as well as implicitly szabo and satoshi.  
  
further i highlight that saifedean's account of how money originated and how moneyness originates in objects is based on an anthropologically inconsistent argument with reference to jo walton, “the analogy between bitcoin and yapese stone money is based on proposed commonalities that are inaccurate, ill-defined, and/or trivial.“  
  
this essay then gives an example of how nefarious constructions can be ‘un-wrapped’ using szabonian deconstruction (properly framed inquiries) and it lays the beginning of my attempt to usefully frame an inquiry into the historical and cultural evolution of objects humanity has used as money as and money-like things (ie such proto-money, credit, wealth storage etc.).

* who decides/assigns this target value (and how difficulty adjusts)
* how proof of work ensures consensus

i know people in this sub are often going with 100 btc, but this is too much for me. my logic in 50/50 is that if btc continues to grow, i’ll be in a good shape in 5-10 years. if government screw it (regulations, taxes, idk) i’ll have 50% in top 100 us companies. if both btc and top 100 will fail, well i’ll be poor, but i’ll be one of many. 

small % and a company match will go in 401k voo alternative. i don’t count that part for simplicity.

the article mentions that binance has some downsides for beginners, like stricter kyc, complicated menus, and the fact that in the us you can only use [binance.us](http://binance.us) (which has fewer features). on the other hand, bybit seems to have a simpler interface and feels more beginner-friendly overall.

some pointers from me:

bitcoin only has limited coins. unlike dollars, bitcoin’s supply is fixed, so it could gain value over time.

prices move a lot in crypto. most people who try to time the market end up buying high and selling low. holding avoids a lot of those mistakes.

the fomo also kicks in when you sell and the value start climbing up, a psychological panic creeps in and people end up buying on a high. 

nonetheless, imo we don't have to pick any strategy as a hard and fast rule. in many cases, just taking the profit and moving on makes perfect sense and that can many real life cases. 
it's really all about how much risk you're okay with, when you need the money considering how much you have invested. what do you think, what is your preference?

2025-08-18 07:10:30,"this is why bitcoin dumps every time he announces he bought more bitcoin. when mr. saylor publishes the graphic about ""not enough orange"", that means the announcement that he bought a lot of bitcoin comes the next day.

the important point here is this:

he already bought,  and tat means that he won't be buying more for a while. that means he won't be supporting the price anymore (until a few weeks later).

so this is a signal for automated bots, short term traders and speculators, to dump on this partial top, since it's a very safe bet the price won't be as supported in the coming days or weeks.

also, they know that probably will cause a cascade o liquidation of leveraged longs. 

so when mr. saylor puts out that tweet it's the best time to dump and short bitcoin.

i'm a bitcoin bull an maxi. and this info is so you can buy cheap right now.

so this is not the time to sell. this is the time you buy the dip.

bitcoin will be back up in the next few days, as always.

but whenever i zoom out, i always end up back at the same place: **bitcoin**. it’s not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. yet, it’s the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every “bitcoin is dead” article.

what keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. a decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. i can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone’s permission. in times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

of course, the price volatility can be wild. i’ve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. for me, it’s less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

i convinced her that bitcoin was a good idea however old you are. i advised her to spend on bitcoin what she would normally fritter away on her amazon delivery addiction. i got her set up on an exchange and she started saving. within 12 months she'd put in around 2k.
she then lost her password, then her email account and then dropped her phone in the toilet. all these things meant she was locked out for a while.
a few days ago, almost 12 months after being locked out of her account i managed to get her access to the bitcoin and everything sorted. 
anyway, the new outlook she has for life and the smile on her face now that she has well over 7k to play with makes me happy. she's now booking a holiday and making other plans that were not feasible 12 months ago. 
she's also started buying more bitcoin. £25 a week.

2025-08-18 13:44:11,"alt season isn’t an entry point, it’s an exit door. the real money in altcoins is made before alt season. early is boring, but late is painful. every cycle, newcomers make the same mistake. they wait until alt season, when every chart is vertical, influencers are screaming “next 100x,” and even your neighbor suddenly wants to buy crypto. that’s when prices are already inflated and the early believers are quietly cashing out.

the real opportunity with **shiba coin (shic)** is *before* that happens. right now the community is small, the price is quiet, and barely anyone is paying attention. that’s exactly the kind of stage where life-changing gains are made. by the time alt season headlines arrive, it’s too late — the big move has already happened.

shic isn’t just another erc-20 like shib. it’s a real blockchain, forked from dogecoin, merge-mined with doge and ltc, and secured by proof-of-work. the launch was fair — no presale, no premine, not even for the developers. distribution is healthy, with the largest wallet holding only around 5% of the supply. and unlike most meme projects, shic already has real utility : you can tip it on reddit and discord today.

alt season rewards the ones who positioned themselves early, not the ones chasing green candles at the top. shic is still in its “family-sized” phase, and history shows this is when the smartest entries happen.

so the choice is simple: buy when it’s quiet, or wait until alt season to become exit liquidity for those who didn’t.

you missed btc. you missed doge. you missed pep. don't miss shic.

2025-08-18 15:59:04,"a new playbook for a micro-cap with a big goal i’ve been watching a small name, and the price action lately has been super interesting. it’s unitronix (utrx), and a lot of the recent buzz is tied to their new plan for hitting a $1 price. the company laid out a clear checklist of things they need to do, which i honestly find refreshing. they’re tying their success to real, public milestones.  

first up is their treasury. they’ve already announced holdings of 5.5 bitcoin and now a policy to add ethereum. the next step is for them to actually show that they’re getting more mined bitcoin from their partnership. they also plan to start tokenizing real-world assets and are looking to generate some yield from defi.  if they keep releasing clean dashboards on their progress and those key performance indicators keep trending up, it could be a major catalyst. with a really tight float, any good news could move the needle a lot. the best part is that their leadership is incentivized to hit these goals, which is a big plus in my book. 

the whole approach feels more grounded in execution than just pure hype. instead of hearing big promises, we're seeing them outline specific, measurable steps. it really puts the power back in the hands of us, the investors, to follow along and see if they can deliver. it makes me wonder what other kinds of partnerships or tech they could be working on behind the scenes that haven’t been announced yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mtq2u4/a_new_playbook_for_a_microcap_with_a_big_goal/,7,1,1mtq2u4,reddit,CryptoMarkets,btc,en,0.9856,116256.41276740946

2025-08-18 18:49:01,"time to bring back app dds to the sub - my overview of turtle **preamble**: 

as a long time user of this subreddit, i've seen it go through many ups and downs as far as quality content. over the last few months, it seems to be mostly articles & memes getting posted, which isn't a bad thing, but we are definitely missing out some research and information on all the exciting things being built in web3.  i'm going to start writing about applications and protocols i have experimented with in hopes to elevate the level of discourse on the sub.

while i will seek to provide accurate information, none of the postings are financial investment advice. users should do their own research and always practice good security measures when trying out a new protocol. 



**dd write-up:** 

over the last few years, a lot of really interesting defi products have hit the market. we've seen automated liquidity managers (alms), restaking protocols, intent-based solvers for swaps, composable onchain lending, etc. one of these fields that really excites me liquidity coordination platforms, and turtle is one of these platforms i've very much enjoyed using.

for those who don't know, i work for polygon. i've always been active in defi and i was thrilled to see katana (a defi-focused chain incubated by polygon) partner with turtle to help bolster initial liquidity on the chain. i think it’s worth explaining why i find it powerful from a liquidity mining perspective.

so what is turtle?

tl;dr - turtle is a defi liquidity coordination platform that connects projects with a base of defi yield-focused users by running structured campaigns to deliver higher yields & boosted points to liquidity providers (lps) while helping protocols & chains acquire long-term liquidity (vs mercenary liquidity).

turtle runs structured campaigns with partner projects that want to attract defi-native liquidity.  the campaigns often offer high yields or points boosts for pre-tge projects.  as an example, on katana's lbtc pool, you're able to earn kat rewards + 4x lombard lux points + 3x veda points + points/turtle boost (5-10%).  for anyone farming points seriously, these boosts are very attractive.

essentially, turtle has become known as a hub for defi users to get the most of their yield. projects want these users, so they partner with turtle and give turtle users boosted yields. projects pay to access that base, and turtle passes part of that value back to users through boosts. the roi for projects can be better than running their own wide-open liquidity mining because the incentives are targeted, coordinated, and more likely to reach sticky users.  

as an example, for katana, while users can withdraw their liquidity at any time, to receive full rewards they need to leave their liquidity in the vaults for 60-90 days, depending on the campaign.  however, this long term incentive helps the chain bootstrap their liquidity instead of spending a tremendous of time sourcing it from vcs and other bd efforts.

vaults are curated and managed by some of the most respected teams in the space like gauntlet, stakehouse, yearn, and 7seas. in addition to the vault curators, other partners include teams like tac, katana, morpho, etherfi, lombard, veda, euler, and merkl (i'm probably forgetting some).

as far as ux/ui goes, turtle is super straightforward. you can view both campaigns (for chains) or deals (for protocols) based on what you want to do. you then deposit directly on the turtle frontend and start earning. one of the best features is turtle never takes custody of member assets and there are no smart contracts involved. you simply connect your wallet to turtle and then receive the rewards when the projects payout. this means that even if you unknowingly deposit into a turtle partner protocol, you will still receive boosted incentives. turtle tracks participation through api integrations with partner protocols.

**disclosures / disclaimers:** 

none of this is risk-free. you’re still taking defi risk when you deposit into any vault or campaign. i’m not qualified to audit smart contracts, and even a well-run program can fail. personally, i’ve been impressed with how turtle approaches risk management and partnerships, but you should still size positions accordingly.

2025-08-18 19:08:18,"what drives crypto price? cryptos price is community driven

some communities have formed around utilities (the belief that this coin will somehow be useful in the future) but that success isn’t a 1:1 price driver, and most vc utility coins are riddled with insiders and the launch is everything but fair distributed

well now then what is bitcoin? bitcoin has no utility it has an idea behind it. so what it is? it’s a pure belief asset (pba) in which a community of people fell in love with its inspiring narrative (which the og bag workers of bitcoin built out) the goal: to disrupt traditional finance, first appearing post 2008 financial crisis as a peer to peer transactional intermediary meant to cut out wall street

the only reason it holds value is due to fact that people believe it does and this all steams from the underlying community. without og delusional bag workers its doesn’t exist today. you can pretend that it was simply the tech behind it and that it was inevitable but without the og delusion bulls who built out that narrative that you think you now understand it’s doesn’t exist

so when bidding coins you want to look for organic fairly distributed projects that’s are community based. if you must bid utilities coins look for those that have good enough tech and narrative for a legitimate community to form ($eth)

if youve read this far i beg you to check out #spx6900 like just look into it

this is the next iteration of a pure belief asset with a similar narrative of rebellion to bitcoin

in a time when more and more average americans are getting priced out of their local restaurants people are going to look towards alternative investments/ revolution 

many people are slowly subscribing to the idea that the system is broken so let’s tear it down, seen with the growing popularity of socialist u.s representatives across the country

the answer isn’t pro socialist policy it’s getting involved into the pure side of capitalism: activism

people here hold their life savings in their bank accounts and dont even consider the effects inflation has. risk tolerance is extremely low.

from my point of view, direct adoption of bitcoin is impossible here. i genuinely don't see any future for it.

2025-08-19 00:39:45,"i had bitcoin when it was $200 and i didn’t hold any back in high school my mid-30’s single parent mom got sick with lyme disease and went from being healthy to barely being able to walk or talk within 6 months. we lived in a very high cost city and i had to figure out how to come up with about $3000/month as a 16 year old very quickly.

not being able to make the money with a minimum wage teen job as well as stay in school, i resorted to selling fake ids. i found a chinese website on the dark web that allowed you to input everything you wanted on each id, choose the state, and ship the id directly to your customer (most being 18-20 year old college kids).

the website only took payment in bitcoin, which at the time wasn’t a household name. it was the first time i had heard of bitcoin so i assumed it was just some kind of currency they used in china. i would physically walk to a bitcoin atm at a deli 30 minutes away and turn cash into bitcoin and then proceed with the payments and orders.

i did this for the last two years of high school, was able to graduate and go to college, and pay for my mom’s medical bills (including chemo). she is now almost 50 and healthy.

unfortunately, after high school i stopped with the hustle and never kept any of the bitcoin. only years later did i start to hear about it

my thesis is  the hodlers and dcaers are the floor to the large dips in bitcoin. just like in the stock market, after liberation day, retail investors front ran the institutions and bought the dip. from lurking for a while, i think the same thing is happening in bitcoin. only about 8% of bitcoin is held by institutions. 

i would bet dca inflows as a collective is greater than what institutions, including saylor,  put in a month.   75% of etf activity is actually retail investors according to chat gpt (5.0 so not reliable) my guess  is this is mostly dca. 

retail fomo has also been absent so the “ wen lambo” crowd is not a part and is staying away for now during this run. this limits paper hands leaving causing price to drop.

2025-08-19 05:33:10,"learn bitcoin through board game! hi, mate! we’ve been working on this unique bitcoin board game to help newbies learn bitcoin by performing real action!

from the begining, we've found just a few board games attaching the word ""crypto"" into their mechanics, but they looks like party games dressed with just surface crypto-related theme. we haven't found ones really focusing on the sound-money one, bitcoin, with knowledge for beginners to learn through. so for us, they could be fun games, not educational game.

that's why we start working on this bitcoin board game! at first, it's a game where you mine, trade, and face world events based on bitcoin history. i'm curious if anyone else has tried mixing bitcoin mining, hashing, transferring, or even proof of work, with tabletop like this?

unfortunately, it looks ""too educational,"" and it's useless if no one wants to open their minds to try it. for bitcoiners, especially in thailand? they love it, but they also see the same points that ""apart from us, bitcoiners, very few newbies seems to pick this game to play.""

sadly we really agree with that. it's as hard as when you try to convince people without interest in bitcoin to pick the book ""the bitcoin standard"" to read. that sounds almost impossible, right? so it's not on the game's purpose to help ordinary people without basic knowledge to learn bitcoin.

the mindset to create this game is changed later. at first, the game tells you ""what is bitcoin?"" but after we redesign it all, alsmost like creating a new game. now the game tells you ""why is bitcoin?"" and that impacts so much! it looks easier for newbies to pick up to play. not only bitcoiners but now also thai board gamers and others spot this game in their radars.we've hosted several events for it, and hundreds of people join to to try it!

what makes us really alive? the feedback, even from the board gamers and people without knowledge about bitcoin, is almost all positive! that's the game's purpose! it's not only educational but also entertaining! so players think it's fun while being educated about inflation, purchasing power, and the bitcoin's properties!

2025-08-19 16:09:33,"bmnr question any idea of exactly how this eth treasury pricing actually works? as far as i can tell, at $50, the cap is at $8.5b with eth holdings worth about $6.5b. 

the plan is to offer more stock to get around $14b more in eth, all relatively soon, so wouldn't the price of bmnr be almost guaranteed to half from the $50 level or even more as it adds in more and more shares as long as eth stays anywhere around the $4k-5k level? 

why would anyone buy at these levels then? is that why we saw massive volume around the $60-70 levels, it was people getting out until bmnr is done diluting its shares and then they'll get back in? seems like if you bought anywhere from $50-70 that you're needing eth to get to $6k+ to start breaking even, especially if you got it around $70, might even need eth at $8-9k by the time it's all said and done with the dilution. 

seems like it would be better to just wait until bmnr is at $25 before buying and then just selling again next time they announce a big share offering, rinse and repeat. 

do i just have a complete misunderstanding of all this? i do see where mstr 10x'd to \~$500 when btc went from $40k to $85k, but since then, that's just been the top for mstr with all the share offerings, despite btc gaining another 50%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mumty6/bmnr_question/,0,1,1mumty6,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.8664,112778.34483555844

2025-08-19 17:13:48,"hardware wallet vs exchange custody: what's the (right) path for true beginners? hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here like many others. i've been diving down the bitcoin rabbit hole and i'm trying to consolidate all the advice i see constantly repeated here.

the number one rule seems to be ""not your keys, not your coins."" it logically points every beginner straight to a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. it feels like the unequivocally ""right"" answer.

but then i also see the counter-arguments:

· for exchanges: the risk of a beginner losing their seed phrase or sending to a wrong address is real. an exchange has customer support (theoretically) and simpler ui.
· for hardware wallets: you become your own bank, which is the whole point, but that comes with the absolute responsibility of not making catastrophic errors.

so my question to the community is this: is it ever responsible to advise a complete beginner to keep a small, starter amount on a reputable exchange while they learn the ropes? or should we always push for a hardware wallet from day one, despite the learning curve?

i'm really interested in hearing perspectives from people who have been through this themselves or have helped others get started.

tl;dr: is the ""not your keys"" rule too absolute for a true beginner, or is it an absolute that must be learned the hard way?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muolur,0,5,1muolur,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9455,112778.34483555844

2025-08-19 17:25:28,"1971 broke money 1971 — nixon ends the gold standard  
1971 — us debt explodes  
1971 — wages stop keeping up with prices  
1971 — dollar = debt  
1971 — petrodollar born  
1971 — families forced into 2 incomes  
1971 — women pushed to work (“liberation”)

1971 didn’t change money. it broke it.  
  
until 1971, every us dollar was backed by gold. you held money, you held value.

in august 1971, president nixon ended the gold standard. from that day on, the dollar became worth less & less. the us could print unlimited money. your savings? instantly worth less.

once the gold standard was gone, the government could print unlimited money.

debt exploded. us debt was $400b in 1971. today it’s $34 trillion.

that’s not growth. that’s theft—paid by you through inflation + taxes. every printed dollar stole value from the one in your pocket.

wages used to rise with productivity. after 1971, they flatlined.

workers got stuck. the rich got richer. the middle class collapsed.

when the dollar became just paper, everything changed.

* governments could borrow forever
* they could print relentlessly
* banks could lend fake money

and you? you work harder each year… for money worth less each year.

home prices, healthcare, education—everything essential—started outpacing wages.

a middle-class family in 1965 lived on one income. after 1971, inflation devoured paychecks. families were forced into 2 incomes just to survive.

women were pushed into the workforce under the banner of “liberation.” but it also doubled the taxable base. now the state took a cut of both paychecks.

freedom? or financial slavery? you tell me…

families weakened. children raised by tv. raised by the corrupt education system.

and two incomes became necessary just to survive after 1971 inflation.

more workers = more taxes = more debt service. which means more stress. more hustle. for less. exploitation 101.

to understand why 1971 was possible, go back to 1913.

1913 — federal reserve created  
1913 — income tax legalized

americans do not run america. zionists have massive influence over u.s. policies & decisions.

1913 set the trap. 1971 unleashed it.

the fed’s scam: fractional reserve banking.

when you borrow $100k, the bank doesn’t lend you savings. it creates new money from nothing.

your money becomes worth less. debt = money. you = collateral.

central banks don’t serve you.

wars? funded by debt.  
crises? funded by debt.  
every solution = more printing, more control.

and fiat money (dollar, euro, etc.) keeps losing value.

war isn’t just blood + bombs. it’s debt.

1914, 1939, vietnam, iraq… all bank-financed.  
wars end lives. debt keeps the system alive.

the petrodollar deal sealed it.

us + saudi arabia agreed: oil only sold in dollars.

if you want oil, you need dollars. that forced the world to hold us paper.

that’s how the us exported inflation and cemented global dominance.

since 1971:  
🔹 us national debt → $400b → $34t+  
🔹 inflation steals \~97% of the dollar’s value  
🔹 wealth gap explodes  
🔹 the “american dream” dies for most families  
🔹 dating market is broken

the game was rigged from the start.

the rich know.

they don’t hold cash. they hold assets—real estate, stocks, art, gold, bitcoin.

you’re told to “save” while they hedge against the system they built.

the system needs inflation. without it, the debt can’t be repaid and the system collapses.

that’s why your money loses value every single year. by design.

the middle class stops having kids. now only the rich & poor reproduce. the middle is squeezed, exploited, and disappearing.

if you want to understand today’s chaos…  
inflation, debt slavery, endless wars,

i was recently blessed with a $10k bonus and i’d like to invest it in bitcoin. i’ve been into crypto for years, but at some point i stopped following the news and just kept holding my bag—no sales, no new purchases.

based on my analysis of bitcoin’s halving cycles, the best approach might be to invest $1–2k every month over the next 5–10 months. putting it all in right now could be risky if we see a strong 20–30% correction, while stretching it out too long, for example, $500 per month for 20 months, would mean i’d still be buying at the start of the next bear market.

which is better central banking or bitcoin? 

philosophical question here(i'm a long term holder of bitcoin but still ponder on these). 

if the u.s. or another country pegged its dollar to bitcoin, the economy would likely face massive >problems because bitcoin has a fixed supply. as the economy grows, money wouldn’t grow with it, causing prices to fall (deflation). that sounds good at first, but it makes people hoard money instead of spending or investing, and it makes debts harder to pay back. the government and federal reserve would also lose tools like lowering interest rates or creating more money to fight recessions. overall, it would make the economy rigid and unstable—similar to the old gold standard, but even stricter—slowing growth and making crises worse.
bitcoin would ultimately ruin our modern economy, through deflation.  something worse than inflation.

2025-08-20 08:40:16,"eth evolution: from pow to pos – what’s next? ethereum has come a long way since its inception in 2015. initially, it was just a decentralized platform for smart contracts, but now eth has become one of the most popular blockchain networks in the crypto world. however, its journey has not been easy, and the evolution of ethereum is a story of constant adaptation.

🚀 early days: proof of work and scalability issues

when ethereum was launched, it used the proof of work consensus mechanism, similar to bitcoin. this helped secure the network, but it also led to significant scalability issues. ethereum was slow and expensive to use, especially during periods of high demand. gas fees became a serious barrier for small investors and developers.

🔥 transition to proof of stake: ethereum 2.0

to solve these problems, ethereum moved to the proof of stake mechanism with the ethereum 2.0 upgrade. the transition from pow to pos was a major step, improving not only energy efficiency but also scalability and security. the merge in 2022 became a key moment, and now ethereum has become much more stable.

now, staking has replaced mining, and eth holders can lock their coins to secure the network and earn rewards. this significantly reduces energy consumption and speeds up transactions.

📉 eth’s price journey: from $0.42 to $4,891.70 **🚀**

the price history of ethereum is impressive:

* **all-time low**: $0.42 (october 21, 2015)
* **all-time high**: $4,891.70 (november 16, 2021)
* growth: ethereum showed an incredible growth of +997,492.63% from its historical low to its historical high.

this dramatic price jump demonstrates ethereum’s potential as a leading blockchain platform but also highlights market volatility.

when talking about the evolution of ethereum, different types of evolutions come to mind, such as technological evolution, social evolution, economic evolution, environmental evolution, cultural evolution, and the crypto evolution activity by whitebit × tether × tradingview. these are all evolutions that have become part of the formation of everything we have today.

💬 what do you think?

ethereum has changed significantly since its launch, but with ongoing updates and the growing web3 ecosystem, where do you see ethereum in the next few years? will it maintain its position as the leader among smart contract platforms, or will competitors like **sol** or **ada** surpass it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mv98xh/eth_evolution_from_pow_to_pos_whats_next/,0,4,1mv98xh,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.9875,113600.90992681745

these are some of mine: 

- it challenges existing power structures (like banks, governments, elites).
- bitcoin promotes financial inclusion and power equality for people without access to the banking system. 
- can be a tool for activists and people living under oppressive regimes.

please let's respect each others personal political views and try to have a solid discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mvacx4/bitcoins_political_identity_a_discussion/,0,3,1mvacx4,reddit,CryptoCurrency,btc,en,0.1197,113600.90992681745
