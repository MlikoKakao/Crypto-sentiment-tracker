the eloc enables profusa to sell up to $100 million of its common stock to ascent at a competitive 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over five trading days following each put, with proceeds dedicated to purchasing bitcoin.¬†**this strategy not only strengthens profusa‚Äôs balance sheet but also safeguards against monetary debasement, offering a hedge in an era of economic uncertainty**. the company‚Äôs prudent approach ensures financial stability, requiring a minimum cash balance of $5 million before allocating funds to bitcoin, which can also be utilized for debt repayment.

led by chairman and ceo ben hwang, ph.d., profusa is capitalizing on its ai-driven digital health platform while embracing bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. this dual focus underscores profusa‚Äôs commitment to innovation, both in healthcare and financial strategy. by issuing cashless warrants for 900,000 shares at a nominal exercise price, the company further aligns with ascent to execute a capital-efficient treasury strategy.

**with its first bitcoin transparent quarterly disclosures planned, profusa is poised to deliver enhanced value to shareholders while advancing its mission to transform chronic disease management and wellness through cutting-edge biosensors.**¬†this strategic pivot not only reinforces profusa‚Äôs leadership in digital health but also signals its confidence in bitcoin as a cornerstone of future financial stability.

***for investors, profusa‚Äôs bold bitcoin treasury strategy, paired with its groundbreaking health technology, presents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company at the forefront of both medical and financial innovation.***

fidelity lets you hold actual bitcoin, but you can't hold the keys yourself. there are transaction fees (spread fees) of 1% when buying and selling. if your account is worth 100k, that's 2k in fees every time you want to buy/sell. there are no account maintenance/start up fees and no expense ratios. fidelity has an amazing track record and has top quality customer service. 

  
robinhood only lets you buy the etfs like ibit, so no actual ownership of bitcoin, but they have 0 trading fees, 0 account fees. they also have up to a 3% match when contributing to your ira. i also like robinhoods app/technology more. however, ibit has an expense ratio of .25% a year which adds up over time.

looking to see if i got my process correct.

1. utilizing river for dca weekly for 0% fees.
2. buy a hard wallet - cold card q
3. generate a pin for cold card q and a 24 word seed phrase.
4. generate wallet address to be able to receive from river directly without a third party wallet.

to send:

1. put in microsd card for cold card q and link it to sparrow. sparrow from my understanding is a wallet i can use to receive or send out bitcoin anywhere, in my case i would be sending bitcoin from sparrow to an exchange to be able to sell if needed.

i would then stamp my seed phrase into a titanium plate and put it in a safety secuity deposit box with an air tag.

is this the process correct and the safest?

  
from my understanding

the coldcard is for convenience of being able to sign your transactions without ever having your private key at risk by putting it on an internet connected device. without the coldcard, you would need your keys to be on your computer or mobile device. this is a ‚Äúhot wallet‚Äù and not secure especially if you are storing large amounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mqdcup/bitcoin_process/,2.0,5.0,1mqdcup,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.0757,,,,,

bitcoin miners like terawulf possess the high-performance computing hardware and energy resources that are also critical for training ai models. google's investment, which includes a $1.8 billion financial backstop for a third-party ai hosting agreement, de-risks the deal for terawulf and ensures google gains a significant share of computing power without the massive capital expenditure of building new data centers.

this deal validates the ""bitcoin miner pivot,"" where companies diversify into high-performance computing providers. it signals that tech giants now view bitcoin miners as owners of valuable digital infrastructure assets crucial for the future of ai.

i'm trying to get a better grasp on bitcoin and would love to hear your thoughts. i've been seeing a lot of posts here from people who are so confident it's going to the moon and that it's just a matter of time before governments worldwide adopt it.

but honestly, from my perspective, i'm just looking at the current world situation where it seems like the global power balance is shifting toward the chinese. what happens if tomorrow they decide to create a digital currency that only they accept? or if major governments start selling their bitcoin holdings? or if a famous, influential person speaks out against it? how does that kind of news actually affect the price?

this leads me to another question: what really drives the price of a currency like this? is it the actual events happening in the world, or is it the emotions‚Äîlike fear and greed‚Äîthat those events trigger in people?

i also want to get back to the absolute basics here. how did this ""internet money"" get so powerful in the first place? what is it actually backed by? it seems like a game of russian roulette, but for the last 10 years, it's only ever come up positive. how do you all know that the upward trend will continue? and if more people keep buying, how does that affect the market?

i'll be honest, i know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. the only thing i've heard about that seems promising is bitcoin. so, what kind of control or precautions should i be taking if i decide to invest? i feel like i'm going in blind.

any insights would be awesome. thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mrjzn5/basic_questions_from_a_bitcoin_newbie/,6.0,21.0,1mrjzn5,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.9955,,,,,

2025-08-16 04:53:37,"bitcoin most certainly violates mises regression theorem and this fact compels clarification or re‚Äêsolution from the mises institute; and an introduction to szabonian deconstruction this essay compares and contrasts different authors from the mises institute alignment to an inquiry into mises own writing in regard to the concept known as mises regression theorem.  it re-visits a question that satoshi responded to about the nature of bitcoin and the possibilities of originations of the moneyness of considered objects:  
  
""the entire purpose of the regression theorem was to help explain an apparent paradox of money: how does money have value as a medium of exchange if it is valued because it serves as a medium of exchange?""  
  
the essay lays weight to the implication that mises‚Äô axioms imply a definition of money that precludes bitcoin.  but the essay doesn‚Äôt declare this outright. rather it means to flip the onus of interpretation back to the mises institute and its followers arguing clarifications of seemingly fatal contradictions with the school's axioms versus the existence of bitcoin are necessary.  
  
thus the usefulness of the essay is that it removes the onus from the casual reader and puts it (back) on the authority that has no complexity based excuse for not traversing mises work. this manipulation of the perspective of traversing the historical complexity of mises work with an authority that would otherwise have incentive to bend the truth is a tool i attribute to being a derivation from szabo‚Äôs work.  it is a szabonian deconstruction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuuC2DiujO4,10.0,40.0,1mrl65c,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,-0.5176,,,,,

small % and a company match will go in 401k voo alternative. i don‚Äôt count that part for simplicity.

if you can mentally handle the debit i highly recommend just buying btc instead. first off no one will tell you this is a good idea. so prep yourself for the nay sayers.

but while searching around, i found this article comparing binance and bybit: [https://st4007.com/entry/my-honest-experience-why-i-ended-up-using-bybit-instead-of-binance](https://st4007.com/entry/my-honest-experience-why-i-ended-up-using-bybit-instead-of-binance)

the article mentions that binance has some downsides for beginners, like stricter kyc, complicated menus, and the fact that in the us you can only use [binance.us](http://binance.us) (which has fewer features). on the other hand, bybit seems to have a simpler interface and feels more beginner-friendly overall.

after reading it, i feel like bybit might actually be easier for someone just starting out.

2025-08-18 08:38:25,"why i still believe in bitcoin despite all the noise every week there‚Äôs some new headline, altcoins pumping, memecoins crashing, regulations tightening, etfs buying, miners selling. it‚Äôs easy to get distracted in the noise.

but whenever i zoom out, i always end up back at the same place: **bitcoin**. it‚Äôs not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. yet, it‚Äôs the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every ‚Äúbitcoin is dead‚Äù article.

what keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. a decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. i can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone‚Äôs permission. in times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

of course, the price volatility can be wild. i‚Äôve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. for me, it‚Äôs less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

curious to hear from the community, what keeps *you* holding bitcoin after all these years? is it the philosophy, the profits, or just pure belief in where it‚Äôs headed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mtgexd/why_i_still_believe_in_bitcoin_despite_all_the/,7.0,16.0,1mtgexd,reddit,Bitcoin,btc,en,0.966,,,,,
