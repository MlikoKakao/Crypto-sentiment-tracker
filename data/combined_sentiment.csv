so let’s clear this up:
if you’re just moving tokens between your own wallets, it’s not taxable.
no gains, no reportable event. the irs sees that like moving money from one of your bank accounts to another.

but… there are a few important things to know:
	•	bridges can be a trap. if your transfer includes a swap, burn, or mint under the hood (which some bridges do), that can be taxable.
	•	you must keep the cost basis accurate. if your software doesn’t carry over your original purchase price during transfers, you might get hit with short-term gains later when you sell.
	•	tag your transfers. label it clearly as “internal transfer” in your tracker or tax tool. if not, it might be misclassified as a trade.

i prefer softwares that correctly auto labels internal transfers + preserves cost basis. but whatever tool you use, double check.

red flag: if your dashboard shows “gain” on a simple wallet transfer… something’s off.

so i launched [https://burntrash.fun](https://burntrash.fun/) a few weeks ago - it's a free tool to clean dust tokens from your solana wallet. pretty niche but useful for the community. i've been talking to potential partners to grow the project, you know how it is when you're building something new.

recently i joined a twitter space hosted by some solflare ambassadors. good vibes, lots of builders, seemed like a legit networking opportunity.

after the space, i followed a few speakers who seemed cool. one of them was [u/diamondmarkiii](https://www.reddit.com/user/diamondmarkiii/) who was presented as official solflare staff at the time. a few days later, he slides into my dms:

""hey, i'm with [u/solflare](https://www.reddit.com/user/solflare/). we support creators & projects on solana. let's talk.""

honestly? sounds legit. we're both building in the ecosystem, this is exactly the kind of partnership outreach you'd expect. so i replied.

he then adds me to a group chat with what he claimed was the ""solflare cmo"" and other team members. the whole thing felt very official and professional.

we set up a meeting. they're telling me [burntrash.fun](http://burntrash.fun/) is ""a nice product"" and they want to introduce me to their cto to explore a potential integration.

but here's the clever part - they say the cto is chinese and doesn't speak english well. ""we use [u/harmony\_meeting](https://www.reddit.com/user/harmony_meeting/),"" they tell me, ""it auto-translates in real time.""

i'm thinking, okay, that's actually pretty smart. makes sense for a global team to have tools like this.

this ""harmony meeting"" app requires me to download a .dmg file (macos installer). no web version available. has to be installed locally.

when i run it, it asks me to paste a command into my terminal.

at this point i'm like... wtf? why would a meeting app need terminal access?

instead of just running it like they probably hoped, i decided to actually examine what this thing was doing. set up a windows vm and started poking around the code.

what i found was absolutely terrifying:

* they're mounting a volume that automatically runs a base64 encrypted shell command
* this bypasses macos's security quarantine system - the thing that's supposed to protect you from malicious downloads
* then it executes a binary file containing malware
* no ui. no prompts. just runs silently in the background.

you would literally never know it happened. could be a reverse shell giving them complete access to your machine, could be scraping your passwords, seed phrases, browser data, crypto wallets - whatever they want.

solflare is not involved in this at all. these were complete impostors using fake profiles and really well-crafted personas. they specifically target new builders who are looking for partnerships or support - basically when you're most vulnerable and eager for opportunities.

the level of social engineering here is insane. they:

* infiltrated legitimate crypto spaces
* built believable personas with consistent branding
* created a realistic business scenario (cto who doesn't speak english)
* had a plausible technical solution (translation app)
* made it feel urgent and exclusive

this whole experience reminded me why i always test stuff in vms first. if i had just run their ""meeting app"" on my main machine like they suggested, i'd probably be completely compromised right now and wouldn't even know it.

the crypto space really needs better security culture. these scammers are getting scary good at social engineering, and they're specifically targeting builders who are excited about growth opportunities.",0.9978,CryptoMarkets,2.0,6.0,1m02rkj

while some banks claim to be crypto-friendly, most remain highly cautious due to regulatory scrutiny and the historic association of digital assets with illicit activity. in practice, the real obstacle often isn’t converting coins to fiat it’s successfully depositing that fiat without having the account frozen or the transaction rejected outright.

several steps are critical if you want to avoid issues:

carefully documenting the complete history of your transactions and sources of funds, which can require records going back many years.

preparing a thorough audit trail covering all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved.

understanding that internal compliance reviews are often more demanding than clients expect, and sometimes even front-office staff don’t fully grasp the process.

without proper groundwork, people frequently encounter prolonged delays, repeated document requests, or outright refusals from banks.

another problem that catches many by surprise is that older wallets can be labeled as high risk simply because they were connected to platforms like mt. gox, btc-e, or cryptsy. forensic analysis tools (like scorechain) can assign elevated risk scores to this historical exposure, regardless of whether today’s funds are clean.

disclosure: i work in this area professionally (swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have seen these situations play out repeatedly.

btc is holding above $118k. eth pushed past $3.1k. and eth spot etfs in the us have now recorded eight straight days of inflows - $192m on monday alone, with blackrock taking in $171m.

meanwhile, peter thiel just picked up a 9% stake in bitmine immersion technologies, a company building an eth treasury that now holds over 160k eth. sharplink just added another 6k eth this week, bringing their total to 312k. and the moscow exchange is set to launch a new eth etf fund next month tied to blackrock's product.

that's capital flowing in from multiple fronts - us, europe, even russia. big players are accumulating quietly, yet retail sentiment still feels muted. the same people who called eth undervalued at $2k are now calling $3.1k overbought. it's the same pattern every cycle.

from here, we probably grind higher while capital rotates. disbelief is fuel. as long as the inflows keep coming and retail stays on the sidelines, btc and eth likely keep moving - slowly, structurally, and underexposed.

my take on all of this - eth keeps grinding up while everyone's keeps waiting for a magical dip that's probably not coming. at some point this thing's going to rip and when it does - most will have already missed a golden opportunity and just fomo in. look closely and you'll see it's already happening, just not loud yet...",0.3506,CryptoMarkets,98.0,51.0,1m1ax8w

however, it is not bad necessarily. the retail fomo and sm hype also acted as catalysts in previous runs. but the multiple boom cycles may have created a new boring normal to mainstream adoption. furthermore, financial twitter has shifted focus to ai stocks (nvidia, openai) and politics from btc as nvidia and other techs are riding the ai hype train. also, psychological aspects such as btc rise from 60k to 100k is less emotionally and attentively impactful as 1k to 20k. 

the institutional money flowing into bitcoin etfs and corporate treasuries has fundamentally altered the market dynamics too. tools like awaken.tax are becoming more relevant as traders move from speculative plays to actual portfolio management. when microstrategy or blackrock buys bitcoin, it doesn't create the same viral social media moments as retail investors discovering crypto for the first time. these institutional purchases happen quietly, methodically, without the memes and excitement that drove previous cycles. it's efficient but sterile - the kind of adoption we wanted but perhaps didn't expect would feel so... corporate.

wurster initially revealed schwab’s plans to start spot crypto trading last november and reiterated the plans in the firm’s spring 2025 business update. at the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the us.

“our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that,” wurster said. 

in addition to trading services, wurster revealed that schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. he said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. this suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.

“stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “we will have a stablecoin at some point.”

but here's why eth isn't going anywhere anytime soon:-
the developer ecosystem is just massive. we're talking about thousands of developers who have spent years building on ethereum, creating tools, learning the ins and outs of smart contracts, building entire careers around it. that doesn't just disappear overnight.
all those dapps, defi protocols, nft marketplaces - they're not going to migrate easily. there's so much infrastructure built on ethereum that moving would be like rebuilding the entire internet from scratch.
if solana does flip ethereum, we're probably looking at 2028-2029 at the earliest. maybe longer. these things take time, and network effects are incredibly powerful in crypto. bitcoin is still #1 despite having way worse tech than newer chains, purely because it was first.

for a long time, the crypto community, as articulated by vitalik buterin, believed in the **blockchain trilemma**: the idea that achieving scalability, security, and decentralization together was impossible, forcing a trade-off. but what if there's a fourth critical element often overlooked: **sustainability**? many sacrificed decentralization with proof-of-stake, some compromised security and hindered speed with sharding, and others opted for layer 2 solutions.

let's find out how kaspa offers a much better balance than other projects, tackling not just the original three, but adding sustainability to the mix.

# 1. decentralization that works

kaspa launched 100% fair with no shady pre-mines, no vc handouts, and no insider deals. it is truly permissionless, relying on pure **proof-of-work** mining, meaning anyone can join and run a node. thanks to kaspa’s fast block times, solo mining is a thing - it's actually profitable, giving individuals a real shot without relying on mining pools. with kaspa, the power stays distributed. it’s the people's crypto, and always will be.

# 2. security at warp speed

thanks to its revolutionary **ghostdag** protocol, co-authored by computer scientist yonatan sompolinsky (whose work contributed to bitcoin through academic papers, and his ghost protocol was even used in ethereum), kaspa maintains incredible security. this means your transactions are confirmed with the highest level of trust. no more wondering if your funds are safe.

# 3. scalability unlocked

traditional blockchains are like a single-lane road, getting congested quickly. kaspa's **blockdag** technology is like building a multi-lane highway, allowing multiple blocks to be created and confirmed in parallel. this isn't some theoretical promise; kaspa is already handling thousands of transactions per second, blowing past networks like solana *without* resorting to tricks like inflated voting transactions to pump tps. we're talking real, uncompromised speed, with 10 blocks per second today and 100 bps coming!

for context, [kaspa ranks as the fastest layer 1 crypto](https://kaspahub.org/article/fastest-cryptocurrencies/) among top cryptocurrencies with current 100-millisecond block times.

# 4. sustainable for the long haul

unlike bitcoin, which faces ongoing debate around its 'tail emission' and future miner incentives, kaspa is fundamentally designed for long-term sustainability. its support for **pruned nodes** significantly lowers storage requirements, making it easier and more accessible for anyone to run a node. this, combined with its energy-efficient design and high transaction throughput, supports a future where transaction fees become a significant income stream, ensuring the network remains strong and decentralized for generations.

**kaspa isn't just a coin; it's a movement.** it's built by brilliant minds focused on creating a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and sustainable digital cash system. while the old guard is fighting over scraps, kaspa is quietly building the future of money.

don't be left behind. this is your chance to front-run the smart money.

stack. hold. tell everyone.

kaspa is the real deal.

# tldr:

kaspa's solves **blockchain quadrilemma** \- which includes sustainability, an aspect often avoided by most projects.

- 91.8% of crypto users hold stablecoins

- 83% specifically hold usdt

- 43.5% fully trust tether

yet, despite the trust and popularity, actual usage remains surprisingly low:

- only 54.3% have ever made a crypto payment

- just 37% have used usdt in real-world scenarios (either online or offline)


the report suggests the problem isn’t technological but related to product, user experience, and real-world incentives.

if you're in brazil or a similar market, what’s stopping you from spending crypto regularly?


what would make crypto-native spending easier or more rewarding?

is it best to exit now, and buy back lower when the next inflation/cpi report comes out? august 1st is also the new tariff deadline. or hold and just average down when the price dips again? just asking, because with all the volatility, don't want to hold the bag at a local top once again. just want a slightly better entry point to hold long-term.

and before criticizing -- i did not sell at a loss during the april market dip. i held strong. unlike world liberty financial, which sold a significance portion of its eth at a loss. they also bought it during the january 2025 highs.

here’s how i understand the on‑chain process so far (pls correct me if im wrong):

1. install a web3 wallet (e.g. metamask)
2. bridge or swap your usdc onto an l2 network (like base)
3. approve and deposit into a lending pool (moonwell, aave, morpho, compound, etc.)
4. start earning stablecoin interest that compounds in real time

it works, but each step adds friction (storing seed phrases, gas fees, network switches, multiple approvals, and separate dashboards for tracking apy). as a coinbase trader used to an email login, all that extra work feels brutal and tbh i would just prefer something easier

so my question is that do y'all know any front end that allows me to do the following:

• let me skip manual wallet setup (smart‑contract wallets or email/phone login)  
• bundle bridging and pool deposits into a couple of clicks  
• show my live apy and projections in one place without five different tabs

***tldr; what’s the easiest way you’ve found to park usdc at 8–10 % apy on moonwell/aave/morpho/compound without dealing with wallets and bridges with wallets and bridges? any better front end suggestions or even web apps or mobile apps that achieve this?***

\- no seller reaction

while most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching bitcoin stay flat, eth spot etfs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. just on friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. and that is not random. someone is clearly building a position.

it’s not even evenly spread. blackrock’s etha brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. one fund. that’s not just a good day. that’s serious intent. etha now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. and that’s not some casual exposure either. its a major position.



after that bitwise and fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while grayscale’s ethe is still bleeding though. it lost another 23 million on friday. but even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across eth etfs stayed green. these says a lot. quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.

 it becomes clearer to me. since launch eth spot etfs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of eth’s total market cap. just on thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these etfs. so it’s not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.

here’s how i see it. it reminds me of how the btc etf flows started earlier this year. just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. eth hasn’t had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. and maybe that’s exactly why institutions are loading up now. the price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren’t even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. but when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast. and from what i’m seeing here this feels like the second one.",0.9232,CryptoMarkets,72.0,18.0,1m9z73p

been thinking about bitcoin's 21m cap differently in this context. it's mathematical scarcity in a world where governments can create unlimited money. the whole decentralized thing means it operates outside banking systems that could get wrecked if debt restructuring actually happens.

during actual market stress events, we've seen bitcoin and eth move with stocks, not against them. march 2020, crypto got dumped just like everything else. so this diversification argument that institutions keep using might not hold up when we actually need it to.

then there's the genius act complicating things. all these new stablecoin regulations could actually limit crypto's usefulness during financial emergencies. the exact moment people need financial escape routes, policy constraints kick in. seems counterproductive.

like if traditional finance melts down, does crypto actually survive that or does it go down with everything else because it still depends on the same underlying systems?also while tracking portfolio performance through [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) for myself i have realized how much our ""decentralized"" systems still need centralized infrastructure to function.

i did a deep-dive and wanted to summarize the main points that seem problematic.

* **a solution to a government problem?** the u.s. is facing a challenge with its national debt as traditional foreign buyers are less active. this act seems to position the entire crypto industry as a new, large-scale buyer of u.s. treasuries. is the primary goal here to support the crypto ecosystem or to create a new source of demand for government debt?
* **an imbalanced yield structure.** the law allows stablecoin issuers like circle to generate billions in interest from the government debt they're required to hold as reserves. however, it also appears to prevent them from passing any of that yield on to the stablecoin holders themselves, who get 0%. why would anyone accept this arrangement unless they were trying to move large sums of money discreetly? the government seems to be enabling a system where the benefits flow to issuers, while the users who provide the capital are left out.
* **questions about conflicts of interest.** the legislation has been shaped by significant lobbying efforts. there are reports of a provision that exempts members of congress and their families from the prohibition on profiting from stablecoins, while the general public is restricted. if this is accurate, it raises serious questions about who really stands to benefit from this new law.
* **a potential source of systemic risk.** this whole setup could introduce a new form of market instability. what happens in a crypto panic that causes mass redemptions? issuers would be forced to sell enormous amounts of treasuries on the open market very quickly. a forced liquidation of that magnitude could potentially destabilize the entire global bond market and seems to create a 'too big to fail' scenario that could point toward future taxpayer-funded bailouts.

this is just a summary to save time, but if you are interested in the full analysis i’ll link the post and 20 minute podcast here: ([https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-stablecoins-the-3-trillion](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-stablecoins-the-3-trillion))

it feels like this entire structure is engineered to use the crypto industry to solve outside economic problems, creating an unstable system that benefits a select few at the expense of the wider community of users.

have been developing bitcoin related systems since 2010 though, so know the protocol inside out.  even developed my own node once.  haven't kept up with all the latest bips, but the base protocol remains the same.

to save time and energy, almost thinking instead of developing my own crypto currency, might be best to just use bitcoin instead.  what do you think?

i recently came across a crypto launchpad called coin terminal and thought i’d share my experience & open this up for discussion. it's designed for early stage token sales, and i was curious because it has no staking, no kyc, and even a refund option if a token underperforms which i haven’t seen before in this space. i had been doing a lot of research on crypto since a few months and finally decided to go all in.

here’s my simple & honest breakdown after testing it out:

**pros**

* no staking / no token gating:

you don’t need to hold or lock up special tokens to participate. just connect your wallet and go.

* no kyc required:

you don’t need to submit any documents or ids good for people who value privacy especially better since the personal data is usually stolen for marketing and sold as leads to business as leads.

* refund feature :if a token doesn’t hit the expected price or utility milestones, you can request a refund. that’s a rare safety net in crypto.
* fair lottery sales: they use chain link vrf random function for lotteries so no whales can dominate allocations. everyone gets a fair shot.
* transparent smart contracts: everything happens on chain funds, allocations, and refunds. no annoying brokers or middlemen.
* beginner-friendly ui: pretty clean interface and simple to use, i didn’t feel lost like with some other defi tools. its pretty straightforward to use. i saved up a lot of time due to its simplicity.

**cons**

* still new / low awareness: not many people know about coin terminal yet, so project variety is limited for now.
* lottery system can be frustrating: if you’re unlucky, you might not get allocation even if you’re early. first-come-first-serve sales solve this, but you have to be fast.
* limited info about founders:

since it’s decentralized, you might not always know who’s behind each project.

i personally think it’s a solid idea especially for people who feel priced out of the usual staking heavy launchpads or are looking for more ethical crypto options no interest, no gambling, etc.

i would love to discuss more with anyone who has been using coin terminal or if you are planning to try it out, would love to guide you through it.

i am also keeping a track on the newer projects on coin terminal, will keep you guys updated.",0.9802,CryptoCurrency,0.0,0.0,1mauixt

each block is a snapshot, cryptographically linked to the past and anchoring data in a way that *defies natural decay*. in physics, everything tends toward disorder—entropy increases. but blockchains are engineered to do the opposite: they preserve structure. they are, in a sense, **digital monuments**—ordered sequences that retain integrity no matter how chaotic the world becomes.

think about it:

* **a blockchain doesn't forget.**
* **it doesn't degrade.**
* **it doesn't favor the present over the past.**

this makes it more than a ledger—it’s a **time capsule**, one that says, “this happened, and it will always have happened.”

proof-of-work chains, for example, embed the cost of time and energy directly into their records. proof-of-stake systems anchor data to economic consensus over time. either way, time is a key component—not just as a dimension, but as a *guarantor* of truth.

so maybe the real question isn't ""what can blockchain do?""  
it's: **""what else can we preserve from entropy?""**

because in an age where data is manipulated, rewritten, or lost entirely, the ability to *preserve truth across time* might be the most valuable thing of all.",0.8132,CryptoCurrency,20.0,31.0,1mb3gzn

while i personally don't mind these platforms deciding not to platform this kind of content, this isn't the first time we've seen censorship via payment platforms. both gab and parler found themselves struggling to get payment processors and server hosting to allow them to use their services, and pornhub a few years back was forced to remove all videos from unverified creators and implement more stringent verification requirements by their payment processors.


i've seen a lot more outrage this time, mostly people finally recognizing that maybe this is a slippery slope, but what's been frustrating to see is most of the call to action has been to try to convince payment processors to change their policies.


what i haven't seen is crypto being acknowledged as the best path forward. what i've seen is a recognition that we have a cartel of payment processors, and if they choose to censor something, there's almost no alternative options to continue to be funded, but no mention of crypto adoption as a way to fix that.


with stablecoins finally receiving official recognition and acceptance, it seems to me that more and more platforms should begin considering moving to them as a way to stop being beholden to the payment processors.",-0.8488,CryptoCurrency,114.0,79.0,1mb3kej

sharplink just accumulated over 438k eth, making it the largest corporate eth holder. bitmine's been scaling aggressively too. eth etf flows are exploding - $2.4b in just six trading days - and open interest is at all-time highs. meanwhile, eth dominance just hit 12% for the first time in five years.

in the past, people would sell into strength to take profits. but institutions don't trade that way - they're not rotating out at $4k or $5k - they're buying with multi-year horizons, using eth for treasuries, staking, and long-term yield.

so here's the question: if the biggest players this cycle are accumulating, staking, and locking eth into etfs... is the sell-off even coming? and if it doesn't come, how are you planning to play it?

some are stacking, some are earning passive yield, and some are borrowing against eth using platforms like nexo instead of selling at all. if eth is really shifting into institutional asset territory, short-term exit plans might need a rethink.

so maybe this isn't just another retail-driven boom/bust setup. with etfs, corporate treasuries, and long-term stakers stepping in, the dynamics are changing. 

if eth does break past $4k and beyond we might not see the sharp exit wave everyone's waiting for. it could just keep going?.",0.9851,CryptoMarkets,35.0,42.0,1mbh8g8

novogratz isn't abandoning bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and galaxy holds 13,504 btc. but they're clearly making a calculated rotation into ethereum, now holding 64,858 eth as their second-largest position.

 while bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their btc purchases, ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. that's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.

companies like bitmine immersion with 566,766 eth and sharplink gaming with 360,807 eth are betting big on this model. ether machine is even going public on nasdaq with $1.5 billion committed to ethereum.

the numbers back up the sentiment too. ethereum etfs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during july while bitcoin etfs managed $827 million. blackrock's etha is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for eth exposure is accelerating.

what i find compelling is the yield component. bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in defi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. that's a different value proposition entirely.

they're positioning for a trend where corporate treasuries don't just store value  they actively generate yield. the genius act supporting stablecoin infrastructure only strengthens ethereum's position as the settlement layer for institutional operations.",0.9857,CryptoMarkets,6.0,8.0,1mbo6q5

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. with those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

anyone else getting frustrated watching this same rejection play out over and over? feels like we're stuck in groundhog day at this level.",0.9357,CryptoMarkets,0.0,12.0,1mbrx9v

i’ve thought about it a lot and honestly, if i were there back then, i probably wouldn’t have held through either. because the truth is, in those early days, nobody really knew what stuff like btc would become. there was no defi, no nfts, none of the stuff we now use every day. it was just another risky bet in a sea of random coins.

if someone in 2016 told me that a a particular blockchain token would one day power billion dollar apps, be used in real world payments, and be part of actual finance, i would have looked at them like they were crazy. and that’s why i don’t really vibe with all those “if you bought 1k back then” tweets. people weren’t fortune tellers. we all were just experimenting.

and if i’m being honest, if my 1k had turned into 10k early on, i would have probably sold it. not even probably, i know it’s a sure thing. maybe use it to buy a laptop or handle some life things, because at that time, that return would have felt huge. and i won’t even think about the next five years when i’n staring at life changing money in the moment.

so yeah, i had stopped beating myself up about not being early. that mindset doesn’t and cannot help me anyone. what i focus on now is simple. learn what’s in front of me, take positions i understand, and take profit when it makes sense. and i believe there is no shame in that. this game isn’t about who got in first. it’s about who’s still standing in the long run.

and signing up with this project verifier gave you some sign or gold stamp that was visible on coin market cap or coin gecko.

the verifier would just have to inspect certain technicals and fundamentals to see if a project looks safe, but maybe that project also signs some kind of smart contract with the verifier where the verifier acts as a custodian for the project and holds all tokens within that contract and releases those tokens on schedule, according to the projects tokenomics to prevent malicious activity.

in return the project gains validity in the market for a cost

would something like that work?

we’ve been seeing recent news with coins/tokens such as even monero (xmr) being vulnerable to a 51% attack. a large xmr mining group/pool qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the monero network by using the 51% attack. they would have easily succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.

thankfully, ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?

# first of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?

51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.

# is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?

yes!

1.      with at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.

2.      they have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. essentially they can pick and choose, that is a big no no (ahhh i’ve been doing too much baby talk lately irl haha)

3.      the group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! that does not sound good because it isn’t!

4.      the entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! wow, that is a huge red flag!

# proof of work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?

proof of work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.

1.      the greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.

2.      pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.

3.      when chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (recommend reading up on bitcoin gold, they have had multiple 51% attacks…)

4.      slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. the only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…

**just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! that’s cheating!**

# how is proof of stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?

thankfully ethereum has moved on from proof of work to proof of stake with recent upgrades! instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.

1.      in proof of stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as billions of dollars for most high market cap coins or tokens. this is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!

2.      proof of stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! in proof of work, they only lose trust, what is huge improvement!

3.      validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!

4.      socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! users want attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe

i really like their mission, which is to bring smart contacts to non-smart contact chains, but i'm wondering if they are going to actually accomplish their goal. flrs price action seems to be pretty good at the moment, and they've made announcements about big partnerships with exchanges and such, but i'm skeptical. their marketing always seems like fluff.

i’m still trying to figure out exactly what i did wrong but here’s what happened:

i set up cold storage (jade), and a mobile wallet attached to it. sent a test transaction, then decided to make sure i could send from the wallet back to the exchange to make sure everything worked. it did. it worked fine.

then, as an extra precaution, i factory reset my cold storage device to make sure i could recover it with my written backups. after doing that, i tried reconnecting to the same wallet and approving a send of the rest back to the exchange. but i just kept getting error messages. it wouldn’t approve or send the bitcoin.

i tried exporting the wallet to three other wallet apps and they all show 0 bitcoin. so i’m guessing when i recovered my wallet using the seed phrase and the 25th word passphrase, i must’ve typed something wrong. probably just one letter or number off in the 25th word, which created a totally different wallet.

so now the original wallet i used for the test transaction is basically lost unless i somehow guess the exact 25th word. i might’ve just donated 5 bucks to the bitcoin network and lowered the total supply forever. you’re welcome.",0.8147,Bitcoin,253.0,64.0,1mdamau

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",-0.9481,CryptoMarkets,67.0,13.0,1mdhcve

so the white house finally released its long-promised crypto strategy paper. and while some were expecting big headlines (like a u.s. bitcoin reserve or tokenized government assets), what we got instead was… policy.

here’s a quick summary of what’s actually in the report:

🔍 **key points:**

* **cftc** will be granted authority over spot crypto markets
* **stablecoin licensing** will be streamlined and accelerated
* **regulatory sandboxes** will be expanded for developers and startups
* **cbdc is officially ruled out** — the u.s. will *not* issue a digital dollar
* no mention of any government crypto holdings (btc, eth, shib, or otherwise)

📉 **what it means:**

there’s no market-moving announcement — no surprise buying, no shib-on-the-balance-sheet moment.

but this is the kind of structural clarity that markets have been waiting for.  
if the u.s. follows through, we’re looking at a cleaner, more predictable environment for defi protocols, stablecoin issuers, and **centralized exchanges** — many of which are already adapting.

**coinbase** has pushed heavily for regulatory engagement. **okx** has been proactive with transparency reports and licensing updates. and **whitebit** has recently expanded its integrations with on-chain assets through campaign-based engagement — especially in defi-friendly regions.

some cexs are clearly preparing for a world where **compliance is infrastructure**, not a burden. the line between cefi and defi is thinning — and those who bridge it early may benefit most.

💬 lets discussion**?**

where should i start? just bitcoin or are people still making money on meme coins? i found it a lot of fun trying to find the next big thing but they all seem to have to turned to nothing, polkadot seemed the most promising and exciting project back then.

given this trajectory, the idea of bitcoin reaching $1 million no longer feels like a wild fantasy, it’s increasingly viewed as a long-term possibility by some investors and analysts. however, the more provocative question is: could it go even higher? could we one day see btc at $5 million, or even $10 million?

of course, such valuations would imply an astronomical market capitalization, well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. achieving that would require not only widespread global adoption, but a significant reconfiguration of the global financial system, with bitcoin possibly absorbing functions of store of value, reserve asset, and even partial medium of exchange on a global scale.

while such outcomes may seem far-fetched today, it’s worth noting that bitcoin has surprised us repeatedly in the past. from being dismissed as an experiment, to surpassing gold in performance, to being held by institutional investors and nation-states, btc’s history is defined by breaking boundaries that once seemed immovable. the question, then, may not be whether it can reach these prices—but under what conditions such a shift could happen.

given this trajectory, the idea of bitcoin reaching $1 million no longer feels like a wild fantasy, it’s increasingly viewed as a long-term possibility by some investors and analysts. however, the more provocative question is: could it go even higher? could we one day see btc at $5 million, or even $10 million?

of course, such valuations would imply an astronomical market capitalization—well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. achieving that would require not only widespread global adoption, but a significant reconfiguration of the global financial system, with bitcoin possibly absorbing functions of store of value, reserve asset, and even partial medium of exchange on a global scale.

while such outcomes may seem far-fetched today, it’s worth noting that bitcoin has surprised us repeatedly in the past. from being dismissed as an experiment, to surpassing gold in performance, to being held by institutional investors and nation-states, btc’s history is defined by breaking boundaries that once seemed immovable. the question, then, may not be whether it can reach these prices—but under what conditions such a shift could happen.

straight out of the box i was surprised at how light it was, i've never owned a cold storage device before so i didn't have anything to compare it to. it was also a lot smaller than expected but i see this as a good thing as it's easy to hide away, which is good for me as i'm someone who moves around so if i need to take it with me its not obvious. if like me, i would recommend a travel case as i used the original white box with two elastic bands around it, but it was too big to be inconspicuous and the travel case also doesnt have the trezor logo on which to anyone who knows what they are looking at will know whats inside. i wouldnt bother otherwise but its not always in my safe. i would recommend the one i got but its no longer on alxpress.

the device itself feels and looks great however the edges on the back are sharp plastic that hasnt been rounded like the front, which for me always feels a little cheap but its nothing major. i really like the feel of the buttons on the front and the rest of the device looks and feels great. although the wire that comes with it is too long and feels cheap, it's awkward to pack away in my travel case and the white box it comes in, i have been meaning to get a smaller wire but it's such a small problem it doesn't really bother me. 

i really like the fact you can plug the device straight into your phone and use the trezor app (i'm not sure what this is like for ios). it saves having to set my computer up for a small and simple task. it's also helpful when you're away from your computer. the interface is great and the fact you can put your own custom images on the background is fantastic. 

a cold storage wallet is definitely a must, this is just the one i decided to buy

i really like the safe 3 and if this has helped anyone make up their mind on whether to get one or not then happy days.

the risk is serious.

i really like this explanation of what is wrong right now with monero and how it makes such attack possible : [https://x.com/the\_smart\_ape/status/1950833481883500554](https://x.com/the_smart_ape/status/1950833481883500554)

i am a big fan of monero and have been for years, but i did not see much discussion on r/monero about this problem and the devs have been sleeping. monero's value is based on trust and if qubic is able to make its 51% attack, trust would vanish.

we could discuss how they are able to do it (is qubic a front for a three letter agency with deep pockets to rent cpu power and attack the best privacy coin?) but the truth is they are doing it right now. if it's not a three letter agency front, then it's surely some kind of ponzi scheme where qubic's own price fuels the rewards to the miners (you can't logically explain otherwise how they supposedly reward miners 3x more than what they would if mining monero alone), but in the end a 51% attack is a 51% attack is a 51% attack. and we know what happen after a 51% attack : double-spending, collapse of trust, and, well, just look at vertcoin or others.

qubic is a new enemy, that was not understood before. by centralizing miners, it disconnects the miners from the holders. before, miners had a strong incentive not to join a pool that would reach 51%. in 2022, when minexmr pool got close to that limit, all that was needed was to ask miners to voluntarily choose another pool, so they won't hurt monero. they did it and problem was over.

but now, the beast is different. miners using qubic do not care about monero. qubic is a parasite and even if it kills its host, it will simply switch to another host (the guy behind qubic already said doge might be his next target). this is completely new.

this is why i said, and others more intelligent and tech-savvy than i said as well, that monero devs should react asap with, if needed, a hard fork. no solution is perfect, but maybe banning pool like wownero did is an idea. limiting pool power is another idea. or maybe making transactions more expensive (who would care if transactions were $0.10 instead of $0.01 if it secures the network). or something else.

the point is : there needs to have a discussion and so far the monero devs have been asleep.

and to those who think this is irrelevant because they are not invested in monero, think again : if it happens to monero, it can happen to many other coins later on.

urgent action is needed by the devs and they need to discuss openly and publicly what can be done and be ready to hard fork monero right before qubic reach 51%.

many people depends on monero for their safety and use monero daily, and even save in monero. if the attack was successful, trust would be gone for good and by destroying the best privacy coin, we would be a step closer to cbdcs and it would be (another) sad day for freedom.",0.9884,CryptoCurrency,205.0,91.0,1me6tlu

but today, much of that decentralized functionality,ike lending, trading, stablecoins, and daos, is being developed primarily on ethereum and other smart contract platforms. these ecosystems are creating real use cases that go beyond just storing value. they are expanding what crypto can do.

and yet, a significant portion of the bitcoin community rejects these developments. many btc holders dismiss ethereum and most altcoins as too centralized, too risky, or simply unnecessary. their belief is that bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized asset, is all that truly matters.

this raises an important question: if people truly believe in the power of decentralization, why oppose the platforms that are actually building decentralized applications? could it be that ethereum and altcoins represent the next evolution of crypto, one that goes beyond just being digital gold?

basically you build up your bitcoin holdings to reach about $1,000,000 then borrow about $110k or about 10% of your bitcoin value in your first year of retirement to fund your living expenses of $100k for that year and pay off say, $10k in interest . in the second year, you borrow an additional  $125k to pay the interest on $235k and have $100k to live on in the second year. then just repeat this every year onwards. so your total loan amount increases every year but that's ok since the value of your bitcoin goes up faster than the loan amount as a % of your bitcoin holdings. any loaned amounts are tax free since it's debt and you're not selling any bitcoin. as your bitcoin value grows higher you can borrow more to have more than $100k for annual living expenses. this seems to make sense to me. anyone see flaws in his reasoning?

if safe and reliable bitcoin lenders with good interest rates are hard to find, then an alternative could be to buy bitcoin etf units instead of bitcoin. my margin trading account lets me borrow cash against my etf holdings. and the interest rate is the prime rate in canada which is now 4.95% which is probably much lower than most bitcoin lenders' rates. and no one has my bitcoin keys. just have to maintain your margin capacity in the case of a bitcoin price decline. but if the loan amount is no more than about 10% of the value of your bitcoin etf holdings, you should be fine.

these approaches seem better than borrowing with a home equity line of credit or mortgage since with a home equity loan or mortgage, you're limited to a maximum loan amount which doesn't increase as the value of your bitcoin holdings increases (it's a lot more hassle to refinance a mortgage if the value of your home goes up).

i can vividly remember my first few weeks in crypto. i came in when everything was green, people were doubling their capital in hours, and the timeline was full of positive stories. at that moment i thought i was late, so i rushed in and made some buys waiting for the magic. after few days the market changed direction. one red candle. then another. and suddenly everything i put in started dropping. i refreshed the chart several times in one hour. from twitter to telegram to  youtube trying to figure out what's really happening to crypto.

i didn’t know what was normal. i didn’t know if i had made a terrible mistake. while i'm struggling with my emotions some of the replies i got when i asked questions all replies were stuff like “if you’re scared, get out” only few people are trying to calm me down. that shit stung, not because they were right or wrong, but because it felt like i didn’t belong. many of them behave like there was no room for people who were still learning.

but here’s what i learned over time: feeling shaky during dips is part of the process. everyone acts confident once they have been through enough cycles. but nobody talks about how terrifying those first few losses are, how personal they feel. especially if you’re coming in with limited funds and no real guidance.

so to anyone reading this who’s new, don’t let one bad day (or a few) push you out. just focus and learn slowly. don’t rush anything, seek knowledge, and don’t let anyone on here make you feel stupid for asking questions.

and to the rest of the community, not everyone comes in with years of chart experience or extra cash to burn. some are genuinely trying to change their lives or just learn something new. mocking or brushing them off doesn’t help anyone. we all say we want mass adoption. well, this is what it looks like. people are entering scared and some are late while many are confused. it is our job to make sure they stay long enough to actually learn and grow.

because at the end of the day, that is the whole point of decentralized finance, isn’t it? no gatekeepers. no elite. just people building something new, together.",-0.98,CryptoCurrency,55.0,62.0,1mewpsv

2025-08-01 21:05:41+00:00,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mf89cj/finalizing_the_patriot_act_mixer_rule/,"finalizing the patriot act ""mixer"" rule # finalizing the patriot act ""mixer"" rule

according to the report, the white house is very concerned with how ""illicit actors, such as \[democratic people's republic of korea\] and ransomware actors, continue to use mixers to obfuscate and launder funds.""

in 2023, the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) proposed [a rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/23/2023-23449/proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions) that would require financial institutions to monitor and report transactions involving cryptocurrency ""mixers"". the white house now urges fincen to finalize its biden-era ""mixer"" rule, which applies section 311 of the patriot act to certain cryptocurrency transactions.

fincen's ""mixer"" rule would deem any transaction facilitated in a manner that obfuscates the source, destination, or amount involved in one or more transactions a ""primary money laundering concern"", regardless of the type of protocol or service used, such as:

* pooling or aggregating \[cryptocurrency\] from multiple persons, wallets, addresses, or accounts
* using programmatic or algorithmic code to coordinate, manage, or manipulate the structure of a transaction
* splitting \[cryptocurrency\] for transmittal and transmitting the \[cryptocurrency\] through a series of independent transactions
* creating and using single-use wallets, addresses, or accounts, and sending \[cryptocurrency\] through such wallets, addresses, or accounts through a series of independent transactions
* exchanging between types of \[cryptocurrency\] or other digital assets
* facilitating user-initiated delays in transactional activity

which means that fincen's ""mixer"" rule is not really a mixer rule, but really a rule that would criminalize **any attempt** at privacy on a transparent blockchain.

notably, the white house's recommendation to finalize fincen's ""mixer"" rule stands in stark contrast to its promises to protect self-custody, individual liberty, and the privacy of cryptocurrency users, which it highlights numerous times throughout its report.

the white house specifies that a guiding principle for the protection of self-custody should be the **lawful** peer-to-peer transmission of digital assets with another individual who **lawfully** self-custodies digital assets.

""illicit actors may \[...\] use defi services, **along with self-custody**, to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions in the laundering process. while there are licit reasons to self-custody digital assets \[...\], illicit actors can use the pseudonymity of self-custody and peer-to-peer payments to conceal or to quickly move proceeds,"" the report states.

to bring this into current context, section 311 of the patriot act is also the source of 18 usc §1960(b)(1)(c) that criminalizes the transfer of illicit proceeds, to which samourai wallet developers keonne rodriguez and william hill [plead guilty](https://www.therage.co/samourai-wallet-developers-plead-guilty-to-unlicensed-money-transmission/) last morning to avert a potential 25-year prison sentence.

[samourai wallet developers plead guilty to unlicensed money transmissionthe developers had reaffirmed their not-guilty plea as recently as last week. money laundering charges will be dropped as part of the plea.](https://www.therage.co/samourai-wallet-developers-plead-guilty-to-unlicensed-money-transmission/)

# expanding the patriot act and the bsa to apply to defi

the patriot act, introduced post-september 11th under president george w. bush, authorizes the treasury to implement special measures to combat the financing of terrorism. at the moment, there are five special measures the treasury may prescribe, spanning increased information collection and reporting obligations, as well as the denial of service for specific actors.

to ""protect the us financial system"" as well as the ""us digital assets ecosystem,"" the white house now recommends to ""add a sixth special measure to section 311 authorizing fincen to prohibit, or impose conditions upon, certain transmittals of funds. \[...\] this would enable treasury to target foreign digital asset exchanges or digital asset transactions involving criminal or state actors—without regard to the nature of their illicit activity.""

again, this contrasts starkly with other sections in the report, where the white house reverses a fincen [rule making](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/27/2020-23756/threshold-for-the-requirement-to-collect-retain-and-transmit-information-on-funds-transfers-and) that requires digital assets transactions over $10,000 to be reported, as well as fincen's ""unhosted wallet rule,"" which was actually [already withdrawn](https://unchainedcrypto.com/u-s-treasury-withdraws-proposed-reporting-requirements-for-unhosted-wallets/) under the biden administration in 2024.

the white house states that ""control"" should be a defining factor for whether digital assets service providers qualify as money transmitters and therefore fall under bank secrecy act (bsa) obligations, but at the same time states that fincen's 2019 guidance is not sufficient and should potentially be rescinded. instead, it recommends that congress should define asset-specific sub-types to be amended to the bsa, and that the treasury, at the direction of congress, should consider ""specified \[bsa\] obligations to actors in the defi ecosystem based on the role that they play and the attendant risks.""

why? because ""the ability to transfer assets quickly across borders and perceptions of anonymity, which appeal to many digital asset users, also make digital assets attractive to illicit actors."" while highlighting that illicit actors, such as north korea, only make up a small portion of digital asset users in overall market capitalization, it also highlights the need to combat such actors, noting that such actors often ""exploit \[...\] digital asset service providers that fail to comply with applicable aml/cft and sanctions obligations, and anonymity-enhancing technologies.""

specifically, the white house tasks legislators to ""consider specifying actors within the decentralized finance ecosystem that should have aml/cft obligations, taking into consideration those actors’ roles in the ecosystem and attendant risks."" this suggestion is specifically notable in light of the report's overall tone regarding what it describes as defi and privacy preserving technologies.

the report again highlights illicit actor's use of ""mixers, anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies (aecs), and chain-hopping—to obfuscate transactional information that may be otherwise viewable on public blockchains,"" adding that ""these tools and methods can hinder law enforcement investigations"" and can ""heighten illicit finance risks if they do not simultaneously allow for or promote risk mitigation measures.""

[what trump 2025 means for freedom of transactionwhy miners should brace for the application of sanctions law.](https://www.therage.co/trump-2025-sanctions-are-good-for-bitcoin-2/)

# implementing digital identities: from permissonless to permissioned

one of such risk mitigating measures are digital identities, the white house states.

""these tools could potentially be used by regulated digital asset intermediaries to support onboarding or by a defi services’ smart contracts to automatically check for a credential before executing a user’s transaction,"" the white house states. ""these tools could also potentially incorporate a user’s transaction history on the public blockchain into their identity profile, providing additional information to digital asset intermediaries and other counterparties on a user’s behavior and exposure to illicit finance risks.""

while the white house notes that some of these tools leverage zeroknowledge proofs to ""to confirm that their identity has been verified or subject to screening by a third party without revealing underlying personal information,"" it also states that ""access to underlying personal information could be allowed at the user’s request or with their permission.""

ultimately, the implementation of digital identities would turn a permissionless system into a permissioned system, even if privacy-preserving measures are taken.",0.9967,CryptoCurrency,5.0,11.0,1mf89cj

i know the top btc wallet belongs to satoshi and has never moved. but the next biggest holders like microstrategy (via saylor), blackrock, coinbase, and etf custodians hold massive amounts. from what i understand, saylor keeps raising money by issuing stock and using the proceeds to buy more btc.

what happens if something goes sideways? say, shareholders sue, microstrategy collapses, or saylor is forced to sell his btc to cover liabilities? a huge dump from just one or two of these whales could nuke the price. and it’s not just saylor, other etfs and big institutions hold large chunks too. if multiple major holders had to liquidate at once, wouldn’t that crush the market?

and people can argue that this is fair or unfair to me this is not question about fairness, it just is how it is. 

at the same time you can bet that powerful countries like china and usa will not accept their place at 1% they have now while having 25% of global gdp. 

you can bet they will either force other parties to give them their btc or they will simply refuse to play the game. 

the problem with btc is that if you accept it those that own it tell the rules, if there was a party with 30% of btc and btc will over time go into one place they can essentially group up with few other parties and even if they not going for 51% attack they will still decide what amount of value will things have as they speak of all monetary value that exists. 

what will happen let's say imagine new country growing just as china did, becoming a strong competitor, they will become too regulated by control of let's say usa has on bitcoin because surely usa or any big party knows that possession is power. 

and so what will new growing power do? simply refuse to play the game and make their own currency, but why would you do something similar to btc when you can have more control over it, like usa has with fiat? 

such dissent to using btc will make it insanely unstable and carry some very dangerous consequences making countries not want to depend on it or simply want more control over money.

i want to understand why one should invest in bitcoin right now. is it basically to give yourself a head start? what is with people who simply had no chance to invest earlier or weren't even old enough?
isnt this similar to people who just happened to have gold on their very own ground which was therefore their property when the gold rush started? (though of course this was pure luck - but being in a position to get bc right now while others don't is also some kind of luck...)

isn't this really fucking unfair then...? or did i understand this wrong?",-0.8719,Bitcoin,0.0,45.0,1mfzps9

as a result i’m seeing a lot of new crypto investors expressing worry and concern all over the internet over the weekend with this small pull back.

but, please keep this in mind… trump, via his media company, just last month raised $2.4 billion to start his own etf and whether you like him or not remove yourself from that emotion and realize this one bit of information, trump is not going to take a loss. the man has the world’s pulpit and can easily move these markets with a one minute rant. and do you see the insane amount of money these solid corporations have injected into the market? every one of them helped put him where he is today and they too aren’t going to settle for a loss. michael saylor has his ear and if saylor thinks the market needs bump you better believe that trump is going to hear about it.

‘why do you think that not only are the whales going all in but these new ico’s, etfs and hedge funds are raising debt to add to the inflows at crazy amounts?

ethereum is becoming hyper-modular. its consensus — secured by eth staking — is no longer confined to ethereum itself. eigencloud’s ""restaking"" allows validators to extend eth’s security to other actively validated services (avss). eth becomes programmable gold: the universal security asset underpinning a decentralized internet.

key economic insight:

eth holders: passive maintainers, providing neutral, commodity-like security and earning staking yield.

eigen holders: active governance participants, handling subjective decisions (trusted data, ai outputs, off-chain disputes).

this division keeps ethereum neutral while enabling innovation at its edges.

builders flock to this model. instead of recreating consensus, they plug into ethereum’s trust engine. metrics back this:

$16b+ eth restaked via eigencloud.

40+ live avss, 160+ in development.

$42b tvl across ethereum-settled rollups.

this modular approach replaces web2’s walled gardens with open coordination. integration doesn’t require absorption: services can specialize yet interoperate via ethereum’s neutral base.

risks remain: shared security creates interdependence, and governance of subjective systems is untested. but the direction is clear. ethereum isn’t just scaling: it’s becoming the world’s trust anchor.

eigencloud’s growth isn’t just another trend. it’s proof eth is programmable gold, destined to secure every meaningful digital service.",0.9873,CryptoCurrency,48.0,26.0,1mg8uke

2025-08-03 05:07:58+00:00,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mgay35/so_there_is_a_post_describing_how_a_solo_miner/,"so, there is a post describing how a solo miner just scored a full bitcoin block reward. here is a breakdown on what actually happened and how insane it is a random solo miner just walked away with **3.125 btc (\~$373,000)** for mining **block 907,283** completely on their own, through the **solo ck pool**. that’s a win most miners can only dream of, while also being extremely rare.

this happened in **late july 2025**, and people are still trying to wrap their heads around just how improbable this really is. here's a full breakdown of how this went down, what the odds are and why it’s *technically possible* but *practically a miracle*.

# what actually happened?

* the miner was using **solo ck pool**, which lets people ""solo mine"" (that is, you submit valid shares as if you're trying to win the block reward all by yourself);
* unlike regular mining pools where rewards are split among contributors, in solo ck, **you either get the whole block or nothing**;
* in this case, the miner won **3.125 btc** (current block reward) + \~**$3.4k in transaction fees**, totaling **over $376,000** at current prices;
* the bitcoin **network difficulty** was at an all-time high: **\~126 trillion**. that means solving a block is harder than ever.

how rare is this exactly?

reddit lit up with calculators and probability charts. here’s what it boils down to:

# scenario 1 – hobbyist miner (~1 th/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260,000,000;**
* there are 144 blocks per day → daily chance ≈ 1 in 1.8 million;
* annual odds? **\~0.02% chance**, or **1 in \~5,000 per year;**

if you’re running a **bitaxe**, **futurebit apollo**, or something similar, you're statistically looking at **one success every 15,000–19,000 years**.

# scenario 2 – semi-pro (1 ph/s)

* odds per block: **\~1 in 260;**
* annual success rate: \~**20%**, or **1 block per 5 years on average;**
* but 1 ph/s requires serious infrastructure, electricity, and cooling (100+ asics);

# scenario 3 – full-scale mining farm (100+ ph/s)

* now you’re mining a block every day or two;
* but also burning **thousands of dollars daily** in electricity and hardware depreciation.

**my point is unless you’re running an operation worth hundreds of thousands (if not millions), solo mining is more like buying a lottery ticket every 10 minutes.**

**the economic reality guys is that solo mining is almost never profitable!!!**

let’s say you’re running a 1 th/s device that consumes 100w. over a year:

* **electricity cost**: 100w × 24h × 365d = \~876 kwh at $0.15/kwh → $131.40/year

so even if the rig is cheap (\~$500), you’re paying yearly just to keep it running and you’ll *almost certainly never hit a block*. you’re losing money every year unless lightning strikes.

that said, what if you do hit?  
you're getting **3000x return overnight**. like another fellow redditor on this sub said: ""it’s the ultimate degen lottery.""

now, given all of the things talked above, why are some people still solo mining?

* some do it to support bitcoin's decentralization (proving individuals can still mine).
* others want to experiment, learn, or just take a long-shot bet.
* some treat it like playing slots: a small power-efficient rig running 24/7, just in case.
* others want to avoid pool centralization (big players like foundry usa control over 30% of the network hashrate).

and hey, **this story proves it’s not impossible.**

the bigger picture is the following:

this block win isn’t just about money. it’s a symbolic victory.

1. it proves bitcoin mining is still *open to everyone* (technically).
2. it shows that, *however small*, **decentralization is alive**.
3. it reminds us that bitcoin’s structure allows for some crazy edge-case miracles.

it's also a reminder to never unplug that miner sitting in the corner of your garage. you never know when your 19,000-year timeline might collapse into a single lucky night.

***tl;dr***

* solo miner mined block 907,283 = $373k+ reward
* estimated odds: 1 in 260 million per block (if 1 th/s)
* it's like winning the lottery, but crypto-themed
* community response = stunned, excited and deeply nerdy
* proof that even in 2025, the little guy *sometimes* wins",0.9911,CryptoCurrency,678.0,97.0,1mgay35

however my last transaction made on thursday 24th july 2025 at 17:35pm bst has still yet to be complete as of this time of writing and sat on pending.

obviously it is concerning for myself as this money has left my account and currently has not arrived in the destination wallet.

any idea as to why this is the case and what i can do to solve it would be greatly appreciated.
i have been in contact with customer support to try and resolve the situation and only receiving generic copy and paste messages.

basically my issue is.... i over invest, i leave myself short certain months and i watch the markets way too much, i knew almost nothing about the market cycles, economics and finance back in 2020 when i started and have fumbled my bags many times since then....ive been watching the crypto market and learning all this since 2021, have a good overall handle on things and have even found some success in trading (although trading is more of a later in life objective for me now)

im basically looking for advice for the most mininal-effort / automated investment strategy that i can follow for the next 3-5 years....

all i want to do, is dca monthly for the next few years... if we see huge downwards price action within the next year or 2, id plan to ramp up my investments in line with the lower prices, and try to actually take some decent profits and recoup my previous years failures / losses in 4-5 years time.


im based in the uk, so limited in terms of my options for on ramps etc, historically i've used crypto.com as my on ramp, but if im buying monthly and sending off to a self custody wallet, im gona lose out massively on their spread / fees etc... if i could deposit gbp to my binance account i would be doing that!...

any recommendations for low-spread / low fee uk regulated exchanges which could help me set up this level of auto investment? i plan to choose about 5-6 coins including btc, eth, xrp, sol... and maybe a few others, possibly a very low % of volatile meme coins like shib, doge, pepe etc just for a gamble...",0.3499,CryptoCurrency,11.0,27.0,1mghj88

i've been thinking a lot about long-term planning and how to diversify for retirement beyond traditional methods. since i already invest a small portion of my portfolio in bitcoin, i decided to run a thought experiment to see how feasible it would be to lean into it more for my retirement goals.

my biggest challenge was visualizing the numbers. how much would i need to contribute and for how long, considering the volatility and potential growth?

while researching, i found a [bitcoin retirement calculator](https://threedolar.com.br/en/bitcoin-retirement-calculator/) that helped me make this more tangible. i used the following inputs for the simulation:

* **monthly contribution:** $1.7k
* **current age:** 30 
* **retirement goal:** $5,000,000

this was the result:

i have to admit, the result left me feeling both optimistic and skeptical. on one hand, it seems like a possible path if growth projections hold up. on the other hand, we all know the crypto market is a rollercoaster.

i'd love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have been on this journey longer:

* do you think the metrics in this simulation are realistic?
* what factors might a calculator like this miss (e.g., taxes, fees, the impact of halvings)?
* for those also investing for the long term, how do you factor in volatility when making plans for 20 or 30 years down the line?",0.9748,Bitcoin,36.0,58.0,1mgkibl

when the eth/btc ratio goes up, it means the market is favoring ethereum over bitcoin. when it goes down, bitcoin’s leading the way. historically, this ratio has bounced between 0.018 and 0.09. so when eth is strong, 1 eth can be worth as much as 0.09 btc. when it's weak, it's closer to 0.018 btc.

i believe history tends to repeat itself, the details might change, but the ratio usually plays out the same.

so let’s say bitcoin hits $120,000 by year end, and we get another altcoin season like we saw in 2017 and 2021, pushing eth/btc ratio climbs to 0.09 again, that would put ethereum at:

0.09 x $120,000 = $10,800.

look up eth/btc !

that’s just my logic tho .crypto is super volatile so dca (dollar cost averaging) is still the best way to invest in this space.",0.9738,CryptoMarkets,22.0,62.0,1mgoaov

i feel like instead of getting real innovation, we got pumpfun and useless coins alongside it. you see great companies releasing coins, but instead of actual use cases or innovation, they just release a memecoin that dies in a few hours at most.

i know this has always been the case in crypto, where “real tech” barely exists and people release coins with no promise, but now it’s amplified. they barely have to do anything to get volume, just look like a company, and you’ll hit a $1 mil market cap.

* on neхо, xrp earns interest automatically and there’s a 5% cashback on deposits and buys on top of the daily interest that can get to max 12%
* binance earn offers xrp interest, but it’s quite low, and i often get (prob) fake phone calls warning me of account breaches, so i’ll stop using them all together
* youhodler offers rates up to around 12% apy on xrp lending. it’s one of the few that competes directly with nexo on yield

there are also defi-oriented options and hybrid cefi/defi solutions that let you provide liquidity or use wxrp, but these can expose you to impermanent loss or smart contract risk. there’s no official xrp ledger roadmap pointing to native staking or a shift to pos some community projects like flare are working on staking-like options through wrapped xrp, but nothing is live on xrpl itself yet. so, neхо seems like the best choice from the short list.

i remember holding a coin that had already done a 3x. i was watching it, thinking it could take me out of the trenches. but at last i didn’t take a single bit of profit from it. not even a partial. the greedy me was waiting for that perfect exit.

within few hours, the direction went the other way. everything started dipping slowly. i kept convincing myself it would bounce.  but it didn’t. by the next day, i had lost most of the profit. by the end of the week, 85% of the capital gone. i went from being up big to staring at a bag and wondering how i even got there.

that wasn’t the only time. it happened more times than i like to admit. different coins, different market conditions, but similar story and similar lessons. i wasn’t taking profit when i should have. i was always chasing a little more, and most times i ended up with less.

at some point, i finally get to know. the market owes me nothing. it gives and it takes. and if i don’t take what it offers when it’s in my favor, it has no problem wiping it away.

so i changed the way i played. i stopped waiting for perfect exits. i started taking small wins. sometimes i would take some partials. sometimes everything if the move was strong enough. and every time i took profit, i felt a bit more grounded. 

there were moments when i took profit and the price kept going higher. and yeah, for a few minutes i would feel like maybe i left too early. but i never regretted it. because i left with something in my pocket. and in this space, that’s what matters.

it doesn’t matter if it’s small or big. the fact that you walked away with more than you started with means you did something right. at first, it’s emotional. you will want to squeeze everything out of the move. but eventually you learn that leaving the table with something is always better than walking away empty.",0.9961,CryptoCurrency,207.0,101.0,1mhdfoh

i stumbled upon this really interesting issue about the future of ai on the internet, and i wanted to share my thoughts.

basically, when it comes to hosting anything online—like websites, apps, or ai systems—there are two main ways to do it: either on your own hardware (that's called ""on-prem"") or using cloud services from big companies. there's also a hybrid option where you mix the two, but it still boils down to those basics.

if we want ai to truly be independent and ""sovereign""—meaning they can exist on their own terms—they should be able to cover their own computing costs without being controlled by anyone. right now, that's pretty much impossible, except maybe on something called icp (internet computer protocol). even there, it's not perfect because the machines running the network don't fully randomize or switch around to make it completely decentralized.

here's how things work today with regular cloud hosting: you sign up with a provider, pay for what you use plus a subscription fee, and that company ends up with a ton of control over you—they can shut you down or change the rules anytime.

with icp, it's different. you host your stuff directly on the network, pay for usage with their native token, and there's no middleman bossing you around. the only oversight comes if you choose to give authority to the nns (that's the central governance system for all icp token holders) or an sns, which is like a mini-version of that but using a different token.

this matters a lot because, at the moment, no ai or any program can really stand on its own without someone pulling the strings.

that said, there are a few programs out there that are starting to break free—they generate their own revenue, pay for their own computing power, and basically run independently. these are some of the earliest examples of ""sovereign"" software, and they're built on icp. one cool one is called bobdotfun.

looking ahead, when we finally get advanced, truly intelligent ai, we'll need a fully decentralized setup—like a whole new layer of the internet. otherwise, any self-aware ai living online will essentially be stuck as slaves, always at the mercy of some cloud provider.",0.9567,CryptoCurrency,10.0,24.0,1mi0cf9

stefan, who believed in the technology, stored the coins on a secure usb drive called an ironkey. it was built for maximum security so secure, in fact, that if you forget the password, you only get ten chances to guess it before it locks forever. stefan wrote the password down on a slip of paper, then misplaced it.

fast forward a decade, and bitcoin has exploded in value. those 7,002 coins are now worth over $800 million. but stefan can’t get to them. he’s used eight out of his ten tries, and every wrong guess brings him closer to losing it all permanently.

he’s talked to security experts, cryptographers, even companies that specialize in data recovery. they all told him the same thing: there’s no way in. the encryption on the ironkey is practically impossible to crack. no reset button. no backup. no customer support to call.

stefan has spoken publicly about how he’s tried to make peace with the situation. he doesn’t dwell on it anymore, because what else can he do? it’s not about being careless or greedy. it’s just a painful reminder of how easy it is to lose something incredibly valuable,not because you lost the thing itself, but because you forgot the key to it.

his story has become legendary in the crypto world,a quiet warning about the risks of self-custody in a digital age. when your wealth is protected by a password, forgetting it can cost you everything.

in 2023, security researchers at unciphered claimed they found a way to bypass the ironkey's 10-attempt limit using advanced hardware techniques. they offered to help, but thomas declined, saying he had already made deals with other recovery teams. the bitcoin remains locked.

* low liquidity
* no macro signals
* chop with no follow-through
* retail gets baited early, loses edge

sunday and monday flashed some price bumps-which triggered fomo for frothed up retail traders. but, as we discussed -those were bad moves to make.

so how do you actually beat the august traps this-and probably next week?

# playbook:

no long trades this week or next unless these macro-confirmation levels start to trigger:

* btc/usdt must break above $120k to prove strength
* usdt.d needs to fall below 4.34%-stablecoin exit = risk-on
* total3 must clear $1.115t to validate altcoin participation
* btc/usdt below $116k = invalidation zone (and it's there now)
* eth/btc above 0.0329 signals alt rotation, especially eth-led

traders keep reacting to surface level moves: green candles, volume spikes, sudden pumps. but in august? that’s the trap. no volume + no macro =no trend.

only price levels tied to dominance flows, total market cap shifts, and btc compression breakouts offer real edge.

want to survive august and more than likely come out booking a positive month? don’t guess. let confirmation come to you. these five levels are your filter. no triggers=no long trades.

not financial advice. do your own research.

# ""tachyon: scaling zcash with oblivious synchronization

zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. they provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. in short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

to enable this, zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. these proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. but the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-snarks](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“zk”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **we can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** we've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**now it’s time to cross the finish line.** i am proposing several protocol changes in zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. the crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that i refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. this new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** in the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. in order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “sapling” upgrade from earlier in zcash's history. back then, we set out to make zk-snarks practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. the sophistication of the sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)proof-carrying data

early in the history of zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-snarks. as mentioned, the [sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. however, zk-snarks are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. this has led to a misconception that zk-snarks are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in zcash.

in reality, we've never actually considered zk-snark verification a barrier to scaling zcash. i once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being snarkpack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

the ultimate tool for scaling zk-snark verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (pcd)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/ct10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind zcash. crudely speaking, pcd allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. this can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

pcd languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. this changed when our team at the electric coin company discovered [halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving pcd with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. as mentioned before, this led to a cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made pcd table stakes for new scalable protocols. pcd can be leveraged to make zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) as we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)communicating state changes

zk-snarks and pcd are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. however, privacy-preserving protocols like zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

there are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* how do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* how do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* how are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-snarks (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. by being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-snarks and pcd.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)shielded notes and commitments

shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [utxos](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in bitcoin. we aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-snark to prove that various rules are being followed. in order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

the commitment hides the note, but the zk-snark can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. this allows the zk-snark proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). in order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. the standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. the user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. the user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. other people use this address to make a payment.
4. the user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

this is how bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. the user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. in private cryptocurrencies like zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. in order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. this simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **as a start, we'll be assuming that zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** the on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over signal chats. in these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. it is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [uri-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

there are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. by moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) in order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. this at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)accumulators and nullifiers

in order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accumulator_(cryptography)). currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. we call this checkpoint an “anchor.” in order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

in order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. this works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-snark proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

if we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **the zk-snark helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** the nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**the scalability bottlenecks that remain in zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)oblivious synchronization

it'll be helpful to recast what a zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

the wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. in each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. in all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. as long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-snark proof and spend the funds. (the wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) this is more or less how our wallets currently work.

my vision for scaling zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-snark proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** this means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. this effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

the result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) as a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

it would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain pcd of the wallet state. this expense is not just due to the cost of creating pcd proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

however, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the pcd proofs) to a third party that i call an **oblivious syncing service**. this service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

we already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomorphic_encryption) (fhe). **but by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use pcd.** the remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. one would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

in practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. but this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. fortunately, as i'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#project-tachyon)project tachyon

this new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. the main changes involved include:

* **wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ecc has already begun exploring the incoporation of uri-encapsulated payments into its zashi mobile wallet. different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the zcash protocol. it also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** this involves implementing and deploying a pcd-based proof aggregation protocol for orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. this can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** this can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in pcd.** i've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. this will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **in-band secret distribution must be removed in zcash.** this can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **the payment protocol should allow wallet pcd state to augment the zk-snark in transactions.** this final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. this can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**i call this the tachyon project for zcash.** i'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. my goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. as with all of our previous network upgrades i'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

crucially, i don't plan to stand in the way of any other zcash protocol improvements while i see tachyon to fruition. i'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and i'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. i also have no reason to believe that tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as crosslink and zsas; in fact, i have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for tachyon.

there are many things i'll be sharing over the coming weeks. i'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that i've developed to be compatible with the orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. this should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

## july payment statistics

we added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. monero

we have to start with **monero**.

it's eating up everything else in our pie chart. xmr now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

genuine props to the monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. nano

second biggest is once again **nano**. our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

it's also being integrated into btcpayserver right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the lightning network.

average btc transaction size was $24.48, while lightning's was $4.42. as expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. litecoin

digital silver **litecoin** plus the recently added litecoin mweb added up to 6.7%.

6.59% litecoin, 0.11% specifically mweb.

to be fair - we only added mweb payments about 7 days ago! read the blog for more on our mweb integration.

# honorable mention: zcash

finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **zcash** with 3.44%.

all the more remarkable given that zec payments were only added 2 weeks ago, and the much-requested shielded pay-in addresses a few days ago. 

# the full data

here's the complete breakdown for all coins:

* xmr: 52.91%
* xno: 17.71%
* btc: 10.20%
* ltc: 6.59%
* eth: 3.57%
* zec: 3.44%
* verse: 2.35%
* sol: 1.08%
* btc-ln: 0.95%
* doge: 0.32%
* bch: 0.32%
* dash: 0.24%
* ban: 0.12%
* ltc-mweb: 0.11%
* kas: 0.05%
* egld: 0.01%
* pol: 0.01%

# kaspa, multiversx, dash, bitcoin cash

unfortunately as you can see kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

we know there are a lot of kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some kaspa people to hear how we can let kaspians know we exist!

another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was multiversx, with just 0.01% of total usage.

we know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in multiversx can get us on a podcast to explain nanogpt, we're all ears!

in a similar vein the typical payment coins like bitcoin cash and dash do not see the amount of usage on nanogpt that you would expect. we clearly need to up our outreach there!

that's all for now - any questions we are of course happy to answer. and if you want to also read about some nanogpt updates, read the comment below.",0.9948,CryptoCurrency,25.0,11.0,1micqkz

one recent development worth watching is eip-0000, a new proposal co-authored by vitalik buterin and anders elowsson. it introduces something called a unified multidimensional fee market, which sounds complex at first, but the core idea is simple, instead of setting fees separately for gas, blobs, and other resources, users would only need to define a single max fee. the potential benefits? improved capital efficiency, a cleaner user experience, and a foundation for handling additional resource types in the future.

in essence, it’s the kind of infrastructure upgrade that doesn’t make headlines today but could fundamentally improve how people use ethereum, especially as the network leans further into rollups, blob transactions and other modular scaling solutions. it’s a forward looking change that seems designed to quietly improve usability and developer flexibility.

at the same time, ethereum’s 10th anniversary hasn’t gone unnoticed. some platforms are using the occasion to engage their communities, bitget, for example, is running a modest trading campaign tied to eth, which they have termed eth candybomb. it’s nothing massive, but it’s a reminder that ethereum is still at the center of market activity, not just in terms of tech, but also culture and engagement. with a couple of days left in that event, it's interesting to see how even small incentives can drive volume and attention.

put together, it feels like ethereum is entering another phase, one that’s less about hype and more about refinement. eip-0000, subtle trading incentives, anniversary reflections, they all point to an ecosystem that is still evolving, still building and still very much in motion.

what do you make of eip-0000? is it just a background tweak, or could it actually shift the way users and apps interact with ethereum moving forward?",0.9935,CryptoCurrency,0.0,4.0,1mid1p7

at the same time, the 200 wma is at \~50k but i think i am even more scared that we are going parabolic soon and that i will regret not doing a pretty significant lump sum buy now for the rest of my life. 

been in btc for a little over a year and have dca'd 2k-3k/month so far (with lump sumps i average 4k a month into btc). loan would only cost me about usd 500 a month for the next 12 years. 50k is about what i am able to put away annually so i could pay it off pretty quickly if i really wanted and needed to. i can also slow down my dca to a ""modest"" 1k a month and start putting money into strc or something to save up for lump summing if we go to 50 or 70k again. then i guess it wouldn't hurt so much to be sitting on the 50k loan with a 50% unrealized loss.

i wouldn't have second thoughts about upgrading our second car for the same amount... and a car would depreciate 50% in just as many months... but why this? it makes sense to keep the second car for a few more years and getting 0.46 btc instead, right?

some key details:

• decibel acts as a full-stack exchange engine. it lets users trade spot and perpetuals from a single multicollateral account (supports apt, usdc, btc, eth, sol, and others).

• every trade, match, and cancel happens onchain, nothing is routed offchain.

• liquidity is unified across products. protocol vaults and user-managed vaults can both contribute to market-making.

• supports direct onboarding from other chains and cexs, with no new seed phrases needed.

""i thought i'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for bitcoin and me.

for those who don't know me, i'm hal finney. i got my start in crypto working on an early version of pgp, working closely with phil zimmermann. when phil decided to start pgp corporation, i was one of the first hires. i would work on pgp until my retirement. at the same time, i got involved with the cypherpunks. i ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of bitcoin. i've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (i was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. i was more idealistic; i have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

when satoshi announced bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. they tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

i was more positive. i had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. plus i was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both wei dai and nick szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with bitcoin. i had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called rpow. so i found bitcoin fascinating.

when satoshi announced the first release of the software, i grabbed it right away. i think i was the first person besides satoshi to run bitcoin. i mined block 70-something, and i was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. i carried on an email conversation with satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

today, satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. but at the time, i thought i was dealing with a young man of japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. i've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so i recognize the signs.

after a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so i left it running. those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a cpu, not even a gpu. i mined several blocks over the next days. but i turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. in retrospect, i wish i had kept it up longer, but on the other hand i was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. it's one of those glass half full half empty things.

the next i heard of bitcoin was late 2010, when i was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. i dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. as the price climbed up to real money, i transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

speaking of heirs, i got a surprise in 2009, when i was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. i was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, i'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. i'd run several half marathons, and i was starting to train for a full marathon. i worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and i thought i was all set. that's when everything went wrong.

my body began to fail. i slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. in august, 2009, i was given the diagnosis of als, also called lou gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

als is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. it causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. it is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. my symptoms were mild at first and i continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

today, i am essentially paralyzed. i am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. i operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. it also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. i spend all day in my power wheelchair. i worked up an interface using an arduino so that i can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

it has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. i can still read, listen to music, and watch tv and movies. i recently discovered that i can even write code. it's very slow, probably 50 times slower than i was before. but i still love programming and it gives me goals. currently i'm working on something mike hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""trusted computing"", to harden bitcoin wallets. it's almost ready to release. i just have to do the documentation.

and of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. i have skin in the game. but i came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. i lived through the crash of 2011. so i've seen it before. easy come, easy go.

that's my story. i'm pretty lucky overall. even with the als, my life is very satisfying. but my life expectancy is limited. those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. my bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. i think they're safe enough. i'm comfortable with my legacy.""

*hal finney died on august 28, 2014.*

2025-08-07 10:18:43+00:00,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mjwadh/trump_will_allow_private_equity_real_estate/,"trump will allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s this is huge. 401(k)s manage over 8 trillion, and a big part of the s&p 500’s rise is likely due to constant inflows from these pensions. if they now allow crypto, real estate or private equity, the same automatic buying pressure could inflate those assets just like it did with the index.

most people underestimate the effect that passive flows have on asset prices. when money goes into a 401(k), it does not sit still. it gets allocated automatically in many cases into predefined funds. the most common destination is broad index funds, especially those tracking the s&p 500. that means, regardless of whether apple, microsoft or nvidia are overvalued, money keeps flowing in and buying them simply because they are large and part of the index. the result is a feedback loop. prices go up because people are buying, and people are buying because their retirement plans are designed to do it for them. no analysis, no valuation check, just mechanical flows repeating every month.

this mechanism has created years of steady upward pressure on the biggest names in the market. many investors believe they are diversified just because they are in an index fund, but in reality they are mostly exposed to the same top companies that dominate the index by weight. this is not a free market dynamic, it is a system driven by design and regulation.

now imagine if even a small percentage of that eight trillion starts flowing into alternative assets. the effect could be dramatic. these are markets with lower liquidity and much smaller capitalizations compared to the s&p 500. if crypto becomes accessible through 401(k)s, the amount of new demand could push prices far beyond current levels. the same goes for private equity and real estate investment funds. the demand does not need to be huge to cause a reaction. when money flows in consistently without regard for valuation, price becomes a function of flow, not fundamentals.

it also changes perception. when something becomes eligible inside a 401(k), it gains legitimacy. people who would never open a crypto wallet or invest in private equity may now consider it just because it is part of their retirement plan. that opens the door to wider adoption and even more inflows. we could be at the start of a new cycle, where assets that were once considered too risky or too exotic start behaving like traditional investments simply because the structure forces buying over time.

this kind of structural change is not just a regulatory footnote. it has the power to reshape markets completely. if the same mechanism that inflated the s&p 500 is applied to other asset classes, expect the same outcome. passive, automatic, price-insensitive buying will find its next targets.",0.7602,CryptoCurrency,431.0,100.0,1mjwadh

one interesting thing is how you can build your own space like a discord server but it’s onchain, programmable, and even has onchain memberships and reputation. not just another messaging app it’s more like infrastructure for all kinds of social use cases.

i noticed bitget recently listed it, which made me curious. not necessarily hyping it, but it does show how comms could be treated more like defi or gaming with full ownership and flexibility built in.

the whole thing is backed by a strong team and some serious funding too. if anything, it’s good to see communication getting a proper decentralized framework especially one built over base.

looking back, i am really happy with this decision, i has been a fun ride, drawing things i love (within reddit's guidelines) and being part of this incredible rca ecosystem. the community here is genuinely one of the most supportive i have seen on the internet.

and to top it off, i have even made some money from it, not ""buy a lambo"" money but a solid **€150 to €400** just from doing something i enjoy in my free time!

if you are new you are probably wondering what **reddit collectible avatars (rcas)** are. they are customizable reddit profile avatars with swappable traits (like outfits, backgrounds, accessories, etc.) think of it like mr. potato head but digital and way cooler because there are more possibilities. it is all about creativity and expression.

another great perk is that you don't need to be a pro artist or crypto wizard to join in. reddit made the process quite easy and accessible. yes, there is a little curve at first but once you figure it out it is easy peazy.

to give an idea of how it is going, i release about 1-2 avatars per month (i try to be in the reddit shop events), nothing crazy. some have higher mint numbers like 150, others less but i could say that many of them sell consistently in fact. you can see in the following charts % sold for each of my drops.

a few years ago, crypto felt like the wild west. it was full of promise, chaos, scams, and moonshots. while some of that is still true today, there is a shift happening in 2025 that feels different. the level of involvement by governments and major corporations is growing, and that says a lot.

we’re now seeing regular headlines about central banks exploring or launching digital currencies. tech giants are integrating crypto wallets, and financial institutions like blackrock, visa, and fidelity are quietly building products tied to blockchain and tokenized assets. what was once niche is starting to look like infrastructure.

that doesn’t mean everything is safe or guaranteed. governments have a long history of twisting innovations to serve their own interests. there’s always the risk of overregulation, surveillance, or centralization of power under the guise of innovation. public blockchains and decentralization are powerful ideas, but they’re not immune to being co-opted.

still, the fact that governments and corporations are building anything at all on this tech should not be ignored. it shows that the core concepts behind crypto have staying power. whether it’s used for payments, identity, or new financial products, blockchain is becoming part of the future.

i’m not telling you to buy anything. i’m not saying to gamble your savings. what i am saying is that it’s worth paying attention. because this is no longer about just a few coins and online forums. this is about the future of money, data, and power. knowing what’s coming gives you a better chance of understanding the changes that will affect all of us.

2025-08-07 14:51:29+00:00,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mk2646/a_deep_dive_into_qrl_the_quantumsafe_blockchain/,"a deep dive into qrl: the quantum-safe blockchain quantum computing is no longer science fiction — it’s progressing fast. and with it comes a very real threat to the cryptography that underpins nearly every blockchain in existence.  
  
so… if quantum risk is inevitable, where do you place your bet? and is $qrl the most credible hedge in the entire crypto space? let’s break it down.  


**my discovery of quantum resistant crypto**

i’ve been interested in quantum computing for years, even investing in quantum tech etfs recently. it was clear that fields like medicine and energy would benefit from quantum — but then i started wondering about crypto. if quantum computers can break encryption that traditional systems can’t, what does that mean for bitcoin, ethereum, and the rest?  
  
i quickly learned that ecdsa, used to secure most blockchains, is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks. at first, i assumed the fix would be simple — just upgrade the cryptography. but once i dug deeper, it became clear that upgrading legacy chains would be a slow, messy process requiring global coordination.  
that led me to explore projects focused on quantum security from the start. i found a few — qrl, qanx, and cell — and eventually concluded that qrl is the most credible bet in my opinion. it’s a purpose-built blockchain using xmss at the protocol level, and the community is focused, technical, and refreshingly hype-free.  


**qrl is built different: quantum security at the core**

while most blockchains still rely on outdated signature schemes like ecdsa, qrl has used xmss — a hash-based, quantum-resistant signature algorithm — from the start. this means it doesn’t just talk about post-quantum security. it runs on it.  
  
xmss is secure against quantum attacks and doesn’t rely on factorization or elliptic curves — the very structures quantum computers are expected to break. unlike the “future upgrade paths” of legacy chains, qrl’s cryptography is already designed for a quantum world.  
  
and it gets better.  
  
with the upcoming zond platform (qrl 2.0), qrl will introduce support for sphincs+, a stateless, hash-based signature scheme recently selected for global standardization. this adds even more flexibility and resilience to qrl’s architecture, giving developers the option to choose between multiple quantum-safe primitives — all without compromising on-chain security. after the update, existing wallets remain quantum-secure and can be upgraded to the new format at any time.  


**born too early**

let’s rewind to 2018. qrl launched its mainnet. it never gained much traction in the altcoin scene and flew under the radar for years.  
  
why?

* the 2018 bear market nuked everything
* quantum risk felt 20 years away
* no smart contracts, no defi ecosystem
* devs stayed heads-down, no vc or pr push
* very limited exchange listings
* bittrex listing was a hard lesson learned

basically: wrong timing, right idea.  


**the world is catching up**

quantum computing is no longer theoretical. it’s real, it’s advancing fast, and it’s now hitting headlines that matter:

big tech is all-in: ibm, google, and many quantum specific companies such as ionq, rigetti etc. — all scaling up quantum hardware year over year with massive investments.

white house warning (july 2025): quantum computers could ""derive any digital asset holder’s private key from their public key."" and ""some experts estimate cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge in the next five to ten years.""

blackrock (may 2025): etf filings flagged quantum as a direct risk to bitcoin. 

elon musk asked grok (august 2025) if quantum computers could crack sha-256. grok's answer was that sha-256 might be okay for a while. however, elon didn't ask about ecdsa which is the lowest hanging fruit for quantum computer and biggest risk currently. deloitte estimates \~25% of bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum theft due to exposed public keys.

ecdsa — the digital signature algorithm used by bitcoin, ethereum, and most wallets — is exactly what shor’s algorithm breaks. and it breaks it fast.

forbes and wsj writing about quantum threats: 

* forbes: ""the quantum threat to encryption: how businesses can future-proof""
* wsj: ""here’s how quantum computing could change the world"". ""quantum has so often been spoken about as something that was always coming in the next five or 10 years,” kohler said. “the conversations are changing dramatically because it’s now no longer 10 years down the road. it’s much closer.”



**why legacy chains can’t just “upgrade”**

many assume bitcoin or ethereum will just “switch to quantum-safe” one day.  
here’s the problem:

* protocol-level changes require global coordination
* you’d need consensus from miners, validators, exchanges, and users
* every old wallet and smart contract would need to migrate
* abandoned keys could be stolen forever
* it’s not just a software upgrade — it’s a political nightmare.

even partial fixes (like signature overlays or hybrid key pairs) won’t solve the root issue. once quantum hits, it’s not patchable — it’s a chain-wide vulnerability.  
  
bitcoin developer hunter beast discusses about the topic in the bitcoin rails podcast ""make bitcoin quantum resistant - with hunter beast"".  


**centralized systems are already preparing**

meanwhile, financial institutions are already preparing for the quantum threat. unlike decentralized blockchains, banks and centralized platforms can implement post-quantum algorithms more easily, thanks to centralized control, layered security, and fast upgrade cycles.  
  
they don’t need global consensus or to rescue abandoned wallets. they can simply roll out post-quantum security behind closed doors. the hard truth? legacy blockchains are structurally less agile when it comes to cryptographic overhauls.  


**state-level threats: quiet and strategic**

the real quantum threat may not come from hackers — but from nation-states with the budget, motive, and secrecy to act before the world catches up.

***what could they do?***

* silently drain dormant wallets with exposed public keys
* decrypt sensitive communications, from top-secret memos to financial data
* harvest encrypted traffic now, and decrypt it later with quantum power

***why it won’t be obvious***

governments wouldn’t use quantum to collapse bitcoin — especially if they’ve already restricted it domestically. instead, they’d act quietly and selectively, exploiting vulnerabilities without shaking the system.  
  
the threat isn’t chaos. it’s control — and they won’t announce when they get it.  
  
during a recent u.s. congressional oversight hearing, it was noted that:  
***“we don’t even know the names of quantum computing companies in china.""***  
— fabaiquantum, jul 1, 2025 on x  
  
the united states office of management and budget has drafted a memorandum that directs federal agencies to fully migrate to a post-quantum cryptographic standard:   
***""everything must migrate to post-quantum cryptography, cryptocurrencies included.""***  
— qdayclock, jul 17, 2025 on x



**limited listings — for now**

qrl is currently listed on just a few smaller exchanges like mexc, banxa and lbank. daily volume is low, and there’s no tier-1 listing yet. it's possible to acquire qrl but takes an extra effort.  
  
a future binance or coinbase listing would dramatically increase visibility, liquidity, and credibility. as quantum security gains attention from regulators and institutions, tier-1 exchanges may start favoring post-quantum assets — and qrl is one of the few ready now.



**community recap**

despite being one of the most technically sound projects in crypto, qrl has flown under the radar for years — and so has its community. there’s no influencer campaigns, and no hype cycles driving engagement. just a small but growing base of long-term holders, technologists, and security-minded crypto users.

* the qrl subreddit remains active with updates, research, and user-led discussions.
* devs regularly publish progress on github and engage with the community through blog posts and discord.
* the team has stayed focused on delivery — not marketing.

what you’ll find here isn’t noise — it’s signal. the community is small, but conviction is high. and as quantum awareness grows, those watching qrl now may be the earliest of the early.  


**my path to qrl owner**

after doing my due diligence about qrl, what has really convinced me was project zond (qrl 2.0). if it succeeds, developers could migrate ethereum-style smart contracts to a quantum-safe layer with minimal changes. that could be a turning point — both for qrl adoption and visibility. i believe a tier 1 listing and real marketing push could follow. so i bought in early — before the headlines hit.

to be honest, the restricted market access for qrl was almost a deal-breaker. but i believed the project had real potential, so i opened a mexc account (which seemed like a good option from europe). despite the mixed reviews, everything worked smoothly in my experience.  
  
i was able to make a fiat transfer, convert eur to usdt, buy qrl, and withdraw it to my ledger after installing the qrl app. it took a bit of extra effort — but no issues at all.

my investment horizon is 3–10+ years. by then, it’s likely that q-day has happened — and it’ll be interesting to see where qrl stands. i believe the first truly quantum-resistant blockchain will have survived the turbulence and likely attracted many crypto holders looking to protect their assets. time will tell.  


  
**tl;dr**

* qrl was too early in 2018. now it might be right on time.
* quantum computing is accelerating
* legacy chains are structurally hard to upgrade
* qrl runs quantum-safe cryptography right now
* zond adds future-ready flexibility
* institutional attention is growing
* and almost no one’s looking — yet

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum etfs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven’t started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it’s interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it’s important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it’s mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including defi and nft trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders—adding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you’re following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

note: i repeat trump has not signed the 401(k) crypto order yet. the current market attention is based on potential outcomes, not confirmed events. monitor the situation, but don’t expect retirement funds to start moving into crypto soon. patience is necessary here.",0.7538,CryptoMarkets,53.0,27.0,1mk7cth

i'm building a minimalist, headless, always-on full node system that will run:

- `bitcoind` + `electrs`  
- `monerod`  
- debian 12 (cli only, no gui)

**my primary goals:** long-term durability, os/data separation, low power usage, and clean thermals.

### planned hardware:

- **mini pc**: asus nuc 14 essential (nuc14mnk-b) — intel n100, ddr5 support  
- **ram**: crucial 16gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 so-dimm (ct16g48c40s5)  
- **internal ssd (for os + monero)**: crucial mx500 1tb sata ssd  
- **external ssd (for bitcoin data + electrs index)**: crucial t500 2tb nvme in asus rog strix arion enclosure (usb 3.2 gen 2, uasp)

### reasoning:

- the nuc only has one internal m.2 slot, so i’m using the sata port for os/monero and a high-endurance nvme in an enclosure for `bitcoin-data`.
- this setup gives me **modular separation** (os vs blockchain data) and avoids flash wear on the boot drive.
- i plan to mount both drives with `discard`, enable `fstrim.timer`, and offload logs to tmpfs to minimize writes.
- thermals should be manageable (especially with open airflow + vertical ssd mounting).


### looking for feedback on:

- long-term **thermal reliability** of the crucial t500 in the arion enclosure (running 24/7 with blockchain i/o)
- whether anyone here has run a **full node off a usb-connected ssd** long term and how it held up
- any pitfalls i'm overlooking with this separation (os sata / blockchain usb nvme)
- suggestions for **better alternatives** (without going into beelink or minisforum territory — i want reliability over raw specs)

would appreciate any opinions, tweaks, or warnings from folks who've run similar setups.

as we have been saying a lot in the last few days after watching other institutions follow the same strategy, eth treasury fomo is just starting and a lot more institutions are going to jump in soon before it is too late and while eth is cheap.

they know that ethereum is going to be everywhere and will be used by everyone in the coming future and all of them want front seat tickets for this rocket. this is really important because tradfi players are recognizing ethereum as not just crypto but as infrastructure. currently investing in ethereum is one of the safest bet. this institutions dont create treasuries with things they dont believe in the long term.

the 4,000 mark is more than just a round number. it’s a psychological barrier for traders and a technical resistance level that has stopped eth multiple times in the past. break it with volume, and we could see momentum carry eth toward its previous ath and maybe beyond. fail to hold above 4k, and we might witness a sharp correction as over-leveraged positions unwind.

the current setup feels eerily similar to historical pre-breakout phases, where consolidation near a key level led to explosive upside. but the risk of a “fakeout” remains, especially if macro conditions or bitcoin price action turn against the market.

what i think i see happening a lot is that bitcoin word-of-mouth has a reputational issue to the spreaders.

what i mean by that is, typically in every social group you have a cluster of generally like-minded people.  they generally all speak the same language, watch similar movies, and have similar values.  but within that community, you have a spectrum of, let's call it one third ""ambition"", one third ""risk-appetite"" and one third ""ego"".  

you have the super by the book people who do the tried and true methods, typically buy a house with a conforming mortgage, invest via retirement accounts in passive low fee etfs or maybe even just treasuries.  then you have the ones who are on the other side of the spectrum.  these are the ones who are always looking for the next big thing, they probably use more debt, have tried day trading penny stocks, have tried joining mlms, trading options, etc.

my hypothesis is most people will hear about bitcoin from the latter type of individual.  and instantly, it's swept under the rug of ""oh joe is just onto the next scheme"", and having watched joe struggle to put his life together, not much more mind is paid to this ""internet money"" thing.

i think slowly the people in the more traditional side of the spectrum are increasing their adoption.  so i think we still have to come a parabolic rise in adoption.

i know this is not really be your own bank and there are better ways of doing backups, like storing them in multiple locations, but i still feel like this idea could have some place for bitcoiners who are not as deep in it and wish to have some convenience while still doing self custody. it is not trustless, but at least trust minimized.

i’m putting together a simple long-term crypto portfolio, weighted by current market capitalization.  
here’s the breakdown:

* **eth** – 15%
* **xrp** – 6%
* **bnb** – 3%
* **sol** – 3%
* **trx** – 1.0%

the idea is to mirror the market cap distribution among these top coins. i’ll rebalance periodically — if market caps shift significantly, the allocation will adjust accordingly.

the goal is to keep it simple, track the market as a whole, and avoid overexposure to smaller, riskier coins, while still having some exposure to altcoins beyond btc and eth.

hey folks,

i’m exploring a middle-ground approach to backing up a bip39 seed phrase that balances offline principles with practical storage and wanted to get your thoughts on the security model.



the idea (hybrid method):

never type the raw seed phrase anywhere digitally. 

only write it down on paper or metal initially. 

manually encode each word using a deterministic letter-shift cipher (e.g., convert letters to numbers, sum, reduce to single digit, shift each letter by that number — so added → jmmnm).

save only the encoded version (e.g., jmmnm hxzvn ljbqob ...) in a text file.

encrypt the encoded file using openssl aes-256-cbc with salt + pbkdf2 and a strong password:openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in encoded.txt -out seed.enc
store the encrypted file anywhere (email, cloud, usb, etc.).

decrypt + decode manually on paper only when recovery is needed.


why i like it:

raw seed is never typed, so no digital exposure.even if the encrypted file is leaked, it’s aes-256 protected.even if aes is broken or passphrase is compromised, the encoded content is non-obvious without knowing my logic.i can memorize or write down the obfuscation method separately (or keep it simple enough to remember).


questions for the community:

is this method secure enough for personal long-term storage if i’m disciplined?any attack vectors i might be overlooking?how does this compare to shamir’s secret sharing or metal backups?anyone else doing something similar?

i know this isn’t a replacement for true cryptographic key management, but i’m aiming for a secure-but-human-manageable compromise.

let's get this right... the guy who made the bitcoin... is not known at all and walked off with some fortune and never intends to return? this is an interesting scenario... let's wind back to something familiar.

we like to think the pyramids are made by humans. maybe they are. it's very likely they are. but some think they're made by aliens, because we don't know everything about how the pyramids were assembled. but nevertheless they exist.. but how do they actually enrich our lives? are the pyramids just a gift for future humans? maybe.

do they further enrich our lives just by existing? how so? do the pyramids exist simply to force us to evolve? so many questions.

i think bitcoin is a bit similar. the creator of bitcoin would've spent decades of his life on this idea. we don't know. but bitcoin relies on being secure to the standards of the creator's ideal. he stumbled upon an idea, a technology, and decided to do something with it to the best of his ability, tirelessly, perfected the code until the project was complete and bug free. but if it were to really work, it had to be secure. totally secure. the only way it would be is if he disappeared with ""the source code"". it's like the source code to a game. it has to be closed source, to sell the product effectively. no remakes and no editing once it's finalized. one and done. this is how it has to be to work. 

i think he will hold whatever it is he knows and has to the grave, maybe he's deleted it. and give his kids and relatives some bitcoin as a gift, without them knowing what it is till years later when it becomes relevant. maybe this is his gift to the future generations of humans. for people have missed out on the property market and prosperity of decades ago, bitcoin fills the gap. he saw the need of something to change the world and give hope to the next generations. and for the gift of bitcoin to work, he had to disappear with ""the source code"".

because what else is he to do? reveal who he is? get bombarded by the entire world and hired by the cia, nsa and all the other alphabet agencies to make a technology to supersede his magnum opus? no. this is his gift to humanity. no questions asked. use it or lose it.",0.9926,Bitcoin,1.0,7.0,1mkx366

dr. richard werner laid bare the machinery of inflation, war, and inequality. he may not have said the word ""bitcoin,"" but he built its most compelling case.  
  
every so often, a conversation slices through the static of our daily news cycle and strikes at the very foundation of our reality. it doesn't just present new facts; it provides a new lens through which to see the world, revealing that the chaos we experience isn't random but a product of a hidden design. tucker carlson's recent interview with dr. richard werner was one such moment.  
  
werner, a german economist with a quiet demeanor that belies the explosive nature of his work, has been labeled by some as “the most dangerous economist in the world.” why? his core thesis doesn't just challenge a specific policy or critique a political party. it dynamites the entire bedrock of modern banking and economics, exposing the system for what it is: a mechanism of control, engineered for specific outcomes.  
  
throughout the conversation, werner methodically dismantled the comforting lies we are told about money. the result was a chillingly clear picture of how inflation, perpetual war, and crushing inequality are not unfortunate byproducts of a complex system, but rather the intended output of its engine. and in doing so, whether he intended to or not, he erected the single greatest billboard for bitcoin imaginable. he described the disease in such perfect detail that the cure became self-evident.

implications) i could not do the same here. my friend that is reading it loves it and is getting into programming now. i love hal finney quote: if yoh want to change the world don’t protest, learn how to code.

this book might be extremely important if proven right because jason p lowery, the major from mit that wrote it, theorised it that bitcoin was created as a peer to peer monetary mean of exchange, but it could be so much more: in the book he compares gun powder that was created for potential healing properties and then discovered to be something completely different.

it also says that every empire and nation that failed to see or accept new emergent technologies, disappeared: costantinopolis was attacked by cannons and the emperor refused to adopt the same weapons and the city ended to be wiled out by them. china burnt all their boats in 1500 by imperial orders (he did not like or see value in boats) and took china 500 years to recover.

the whole book is a preparation to the final chapters: he starts with examples on nature on how watts in nature are an absolute proof of an action being performed (an attack from a predator to a prey) and in the same way the proof of work makes it inconfutabile that a bitcoin has been created, but also has the double function of making it ridiculously expensive for an attacker to even try to attack.

 the real shift, he says, will happen when countries understand that bitcoin’s proof of work is not just about creating digital money. it is actually a way to protect and show power in the digital world without needing to fight wars in the physical world.

lowery explains that just like gunpowder changed how battles were fought, proof of work could change how nations defend themselves in the future. instead of sending soldiers to fight over land, countries could use mining power to protect their digital space. the more energy they put into mining, the harder and more expensive it becomes for anyone to attack them.

he describes a future where the bitcoin network is not only about money but is also like a giant shield for the whole world. a shield that works because it is built on real energy and math, and no one can fake it.

if he is right, then bitcoin’s most important use might not be money at all. it could be the first system in history that lets the whole world protect itself without violence. 

and history shows that when new technology appears, the people or countries that ignore it usually fall behind (looking at you germany) while the ones who accept it lead the future (bhutan gets it right).

i highly recommend to read the book, you can read it for free or amazon is printing a copy since the original prints were discontinued and the first prints are being sold for a lot of money now.

if this theory will be proven right, it will reshape the world, hopefully for the better.",-0.7031,Bitcoin,283.0,84.0,1mlg6xi

""won't this give developers far more capabilities than any of today's vms which are very limited?""


yes—absolutely. what qanplatform is doing with hermit and its qvm does give developers far more capabilities than traditional smart contract vms today.

let’s unpack that clearly:

💡 1. most smart contract vms are extremely limited
current blockchain vms like:

evm (ethereum virtual machine)

wasm-based vms (e.g., polkadot, near)

movevm (aptos/sui)

...are intentionally restricted for:

security (no file access, threading, or unrestricted memory use)

determinism (all nodes must get the same result)

resource control (gas limits, cycle counting)

trade-off: high security, but poor developer freedom. you're stuck with:

limited languages (solidity, rust, move)

no standard linux features (threads, syscalls, shared memory, filesystems)

no support for existing c/c++/go tools

🧠 2. qan’s approach: deterministic execution of native binaries
qan’s qvm (via hermit) allows:

running native linux elf binaries (e.g., compiled c/c++/rust/go)

using a much larger subset of the standard c library

leveraging existing developer tooling, debugging, profiling

no need to rewrite everything in a limited blockchain-specific language

✅ this is a huge gain in capability:

developers can port existing codebases

write complex logic in familiar languages

even interface with legacy enterprise systems (theoretically)

in essence: qan offers the closest thing to a full os sandbox on-chain, but still aims for deterministic results (via hermit).

between steady on-chain activity, a rise in institutional mentions, and a noticeable uptick in social volume (especially from accounts that usually ignore xrp), i feel like we’re heading into one of those classic xrp pre-breakout phases.

i’m not saying we’re about to 10x next week, but the relative silence compared to the rest of the market feels… intentional. sort of like how sol was being accumulated low-key before it ran. same energy here.

i’ve held xrp through all the noise, fud, and lawsuits - and honestly i’ve never seen the market this evenly split between indifference and quiet conviction. i’ve personally decided to reposition part of my xrp holdings into yield, just to make use of the lull.

for those interested, i recently moved some xrp to nexo, where they’re running a 5% xrp-back promo, and optionally offering up to 12% apr if you stake. i’m not going heavy on staking, but the bonus was a no-brainer since i was rotating wallets anyway. 

what’s tricky is that xrp tends to move when people least expect it. i wouldn’t be surprised if we’re in a classic accumulation zone before something bigger plays out, especially if macro factors or another ripple announcement kicks in.",0.9593,CryptoMarkets,6.0,15.0,1mlonah

full disclosure, i do not own any meaningful bags in either three of the projects that i’m going to mention.   i’ve been watching projects such as aioz network, aleph cloud, and arweave, and i can’t shake the feeling these could be the backbone of robotics and ai in the real world.

aioz has partnerships with alibaba cloud, nvidia, neo blockchain, qualcomm, and google for startups. its decentralized streaming, ai compute, and storage could power robotics systems that need to process and share huge amounts of data in real time without depending on one central server.

aleph cloud is already working with ubisoft and hyperswap and has a $1m accelerator for new projects. its multi-chain “supercloud” with private compute, dynamic storage, and upcoming gpu power could give robots and ai agents secure, low-latency access to the computing resources they need anywhere in the world.

arweave is permanent decentralized storage, already used by major organizations. for robotics, it could mean keeping critical training data, operational logs, and ai models stored forever and instantly accessible without the risk of losing it if a company shuts down a server.

if robotics and automation are going to be everywhere in factories, logistics, healthcare, and homes, don’t we need exactly these kinds of decentralized and resilient systems to keep them running?

so why aren’t these moving? is it just too early for the market to catch up, or am i missing something? i’d love to hear from people with backgrounds in computer science, ai, robotics, or coding who can explain the gap, because to me this looks like inevitable infrastructure for the future.

honestly not sure how to read this one. on one hand, dude literally just helped set up what they're calling the ""crypto capital of the world"" setup.

but also... timing feels weird? we're barely into the new admin and key crypto people are already leaving? makes me wonder if there's some behind the scenes drama...

what's the play here? does this change anything for the whole strategic bitcoin reserve narrative or just standard washington shuffling?

curious what you guys think - market doesn't seem to care much right now but wondering if this matters more than it looks

the market’s pretty unfazed so far—most traders and whales seem to think it’s just typical political churn, not a sign of the admin backing off its crypto roadmap. with interagency teams and new reports dropping, momentum looks solid, but the main drama is: will the next director actually get the reserve built, or will it stay all talk?.

btw, i use awaken.tax for tracking trades and tax filing—it flagged nothing unusual from the political side except more buzz about reporting on government crypto moves. if you’re trying to log your own trades, stuff like these leadership switches don’t impact direct filings, but it’s worth watching if policy shifts mean new reporting requirements down the line, especially if congress pushes for full transparency on wallet holdings and acquisition methods. anyone else seeing updates or alerts from their tax platforms since this whole shake-up?",0.9328,CryptoMarkets,0.0,3.0,1mm0vjc

[cryptocurrency group claims credit for wnba 'dildogate'](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/bernadette-giacomazzo/cryptocurrency-group-claims-credit-for-wnba-dildogate)

  
a self-described cryptocurrency enthusiast has claimed that his online cryptocurrency community coordinated the recent sex-toy tosses that disrupted multiple [wnba](https://www.complex.com/tag/wnba) games, saying the stunts were designed to promote a coin the group created.

the man, who uses the handle “lt. daldo raine,” spoke anonymously to [espn](https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45923322/crypto-group-says-orchestrated-sex-toy-tosses-wnba-games) over a video conference, kept his camera off, and declined to share his name or age.

he said the coin began trading on july 28—one day before the first incident on july 29, [when a green sex toy was thrown during the atlanta dream–golden state valkyries game](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/bernadette-giacomazzo/wnba-game-halted-by-fan-throwing-a-very-nsfw-object-at-players), leading to a fourth-quarter postponement.

play

espn reviewed posts from the group’s telegram channel, which had more than 1,000 users, that featured advanced chatter, a link to the game stream, and celebratory comments. a wnba spokesperson declined to comment on the claim.

wnbpa executive director terri jackson said the union requested an update and was told the league is investigating whether individuals were incentivized to participate.

two arrests have followed. delbert carver, 23, of marietta, georgia, was arrested aug. 1 in connection with a toss at the end of a dream–phoenix mercury game and faces counts including disorderly conduct, public indecency/indecent exposure, and criminal trespass.

police say he tried to flee and admitted to throwing the first object on july 29; the crypto source said carver isn’t affiliated with the group and wasn’t the original thrower.

also on aug. 1, another green object was tossed during the chicago sky–valkyries game. [player sophie cunningham posted on x](https://www.complex.com/sports/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/sophie-cunningham-wnba-fans-stop-throwing-dildos-court), “stop throwing dildos on the court.”

coordinated attempts continued tuesday across four arenas. in phoenix, 18-year-old kaden lopez was arrested after a throw that hit two spectators, including a minor; he faces misdemeanor disorderly conduct and assault after a felony count was dropped.

a planned attempt in seattle did not occur. the wnba reiterated that anyone who throws an object will be ejected and face a minimum one-year ban, with potential arrest and prosecution.

since july 29, the coin’s price has climbed about 300%, google searches for “green dildo” have spiked 3,700%, and at least one sportsbook offered prop bets that group members allegedly exploited. the group says it will pivot away from wnba games to less disruptive stunts, citing a sighting at a marlins–astros mlb game.",-0.9372,CryptoCurrency,0.0,5.0,1mm3odt

i want to share something bullish about ada. this chart shows cardano when measured in xrp. cardano has lost 93% of its value relative to xrp since early 2021 as 1 ada is now equal to less than 0.25 xrp. this isn't a shitpost on ada. it's bullish because it means ada is undervalued relative to xrp. years of underperformance now the create the conditions for a reversal on this chart. i do expect ada to outperform xrp going forward. the charts is also at a multi-year support level of 0.25 xrp. we have seen big bounces from this level in the past and i expect to see it again as ada approaches $5+

some might say this chart has no significance. but i disagree. remember when everyone on this sub was mega bearish on eth back in april....well we saw eth/btc hit key support levels and now a rapid v-shape recovery. this wasn't a coincidence:

eth has punched through the 4k barrier in the last few days, and even touched 4.3k a couple of times. i expect there will be a bit more of a tug of war before the next break out.

in the last 30 days, eth is +46% while the market leader, btc, is just +1%.

from 0.025 to 0.036 in the eth/btc ratio.

in the last 90 days, eth is +71% the market leader, btc, is +11%.

we can see from the graph and stats below, eth dominance has risen quite nicely compared to the rest of the market.

throwback to the last cycle; after btc dominance reaches it's high, eth moves next, followed by the mythical alt-season!

granted, there are a lot more projects up and running now, but we have seen the first step, which is eth start to rise accordingly. should history rhyme, eth will continue to out-perform the market leader for another period of time, until the markets become euphoric and we enter the alt-season.

[https://www.thealtsignal.com/](https://www.thealtsignal.com/) according to the alt-signal we are now 3/6 checks highlighting this!

as i said, history doesn't always repeat itself, but it often rhymes, and a lot is different this time round in terms of sentiment, regulation, adoption, politics, economy etc, but at the same time; if the crypto-cycle continues once again, we are in for one hell of a ride!

i deposit money into binance once a month, and the rest of the process is automated — i don’t think too much about it, the system makes purchases according to the set dca (dollar-cost averaging) strategy. i’m also thinking, in addition to the index-linked dca strategy, about starting a bitcoin-only dca strategy. should i split my investments 50-50 between the two strategies, or go 30-70?

i’m interested in whether anyone has a recommendation for improving this strategy or a suggestion for alternative platforms that offer similar tools for automatic investing.

i’d also like advice regarding investment diversification. in addition to cryptocurrencies, i’m considering investing in the stock market (stocks), etfs, gold, or other assets.
how should i best allocate the money? where should i open accounts? which platforms do you use and why? is it better to have everything in one place, or split between multiple brokers/platforms?

bought trx, xrp, and a bunch of random altcoins. lost $2,700 in a few months. then i tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. honestly, i almost quit.

in 2019, i decided to stop gambling and start learning. i studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. i didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

by 2020, i was finally making small profits. took only setups i trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. made around $4,800 on a $3k account. nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? i was ready. i grew my account to over $43k trading eth, sol, and a few strong alts. but i got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. that lesson hurt, but it stuck.

2022 was survival mode. i traded less, avoided trying to “buy the dip,” and focused on capital preservation. profits were small, but i didn’t lose.

from 2023 to now, i’ve kept it boring: 1% risk per trade, only 2–3 reliable setups, and strict journaling. i don’t trade every day. i don’t chase pumps. i just stick to what works.

in 2024, i crossed $100k in my trading account. no moonshots. just consistency over time.

tl;dr

lost money in 2018 (like most beginners) started learning & tracking everything in 2019 profitable by 2020, stayed consistent bull run helped, but greed punished me in 2021 focused on capital protection in 2022 2023–2025: steady growth, no drama finally passed $100k in 2024 biggest lessons:

you won’t get rich overnight. risk management > everything. you don’t need to trade every day. journaling your trades = free edge. survive long enough, and your edge will show up. happy to answer questions if anyone’s stuck in the early phase like i was. stay in the game.",0.7556,CryptoMarkets,249.0,147.0,1mmhcfi

short backstory (the facts):
• i contributed to my school district’s 403(b) for about 12 years and eventually stopped. the plan providers felt predatory — terrible products, high fees, advisors who didn’t appear to add value. i rolled the account to a new firm and discovered the fees were still worse than i thought. i felt cheated and frustrated.
• i researched alternatives and got deep into bitcoin. i decided i wanted control of my savings and moved aggressively. i borrowed against my retirement plan (took a loan from it) and invested that money into btc. there’s a small cost for borrowing back to me via the plan (1–2%), and i understand the mechanics and obligations.
• separately i took a bank loan of roughly $22,000 at 0% apr for 21 months to accelerate payoff of other debts and for liquidity. that’s being paid down aggressively.
• now my bank has offered an additional, smaller loan at 0% apr for 12 months. i’m seriously considering taking that new 12-month 0% loan and investing it directly into bitcoin (i’d put most of it into btc and keep a small cash reserve for immediate needs). the plan is to repay the loan from gains if btc performs as i expect over the next year.
• i’ve asked ai and gotten the standard conservative advice: don’t gamble, pay down debt, don’t lever into volatile assets. i get that. i’m asking this community for perspectives i haven’t considered — practical, real-world feedback from people who have been through something similar or who can point out angles i might be missing.

where my head is:
• i believe in bitcoin’s long-term thesis — adoption by institutions, more legitimate infrastructure, etc. i think it’s likely to do well over the next year, but i also know one-year outcomes can be wildly different (huge gains or painful drawdowns).
• i really don’t want to liquidate my existing btc position — emotionally and strategically i’d rather hold. that’s why i’m considering this 0% loan route to add exposure rather than sell.
• i’m disciplined on repayment timelines and i’m comfortable making monthly payments, but adding another loan increases complexity and downside if btc goes the wrong way.

what i’m trying to get from you: practical, experience-based input (not cheerleading)
	1.	have you ever used a 0% promotional loan to buy btc (or any volatile asset)? if yes: what actually happened, and what did you wish you’d known beforehand?
	2.	if you took that route and btc dropped materially, how did you manage the repayment pressure? (did you sell, pull from savings, extend credit, or something else?)
	3.	what guardrails would you suggest if someone insists on doing this? (example ideas i’m considering: only invest part of the loan, put a portion in hysa as an emergency buffer, set a hard stop-loss plan, secure custody, set aside taxes, etc.) which of these actually helped in practice?
	4.	tax/timing notes: if i profit within a 12-month window and must sell to repay the loan, i know gains may be short-term taxed. people who have done this — how did the tax hit affect your math? any practical tax planning tips (without asking for personalized tax advice)?
	5.	alternatives i may be overlooking: i know ai says “don’t gamble.” i’m looking for smarter middle-ground options people actually used that preserved upside but limited downside. examples i’m curious about: partial loan → partial btc, or using options to hedge (i know options are advanced — stories or cautionary tales welcome).
	6.	emotional / psychological things: anyone who’s been through a leveraged crypto move — how did it feel day-to-day? how did you cope with volatility while carrying a repayment obligation? practical coping strategies welcomed.

a few practical facts i want people to respond to rather than lecture about:
• i’m not asking whether crypto is risky — i know it is. i want to know how people manage that risk when they chose to leverage.
• i understand worst-case outcomes and accept the possibility of losing money. i’m trying to decide whether my risk controls are reasonable.
• i will not dump my entire retirement or emergency savings. this would be a targeted incremental bet.

if you’re going to reply, please be pragmatic: numbers, timelines, what actually worked or didn’t, tax realities you ran into, custody lessons, or simple hard-won truths. i’ve read a lot of theory; i want practice.

thanks in advance. i’ll read every reply and synthesize. if it helps, i’ll post a follow-up with the decision i make and why — so others can learn from the outcome.",0.9345,Bitcoin,4.0,22.0,1mmvy3t

below are the affected wallets:

* 0x8f4dd47f9cff6b2af1ef0be7ad2263e5784b64d7 - victim

* 0x321d42288d1585a2dd03f0b59a81b69e0292f71f - drainer customer

there's a few unique instances about this particular drain that lead me to post about it. 

the first is that this appears to be the work of inferno/angel drainer. 

# inferno/angel drainer

inferno drainer was acquired by angel drainer in oct 2024 for an undisclosed sum. 

[the telegram message coming from the inferno drainer team announcing the intent to hand over their source code to angel drainer.](https://preview.redd.it/togynmomz9if1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=c24e2aef6757bd6449325a4e0c7db46952f2f792)

the acquisition was announced about a year after inferno drainer ""claimed"" to have shutdown. we now know that to be false.

the wallet 0x0be1c.....a144 is an inferno/angel admin wallet that's about two weeks old. when inferno drainer was operating as it's own entity, these wallets tend to get rotated every 6 - 8 months. 

now, most likely due to anti-phishing technology catching up to drainer methods, i'm starting to see these wallets getting rotated every 2 - 3 weeks. 

additionally, instead of the wallet drain taking place in one transaction, on-chain evidence shows there's 12 that happen simultaneously. i spot checked another contract from the admin wallet and it also showed 12 separate transactions.

[above is an example of what happens on-chain when a user gives token approval. funds from the user's wallet go to 0x960...ea73a - the malicious contract operated by inferno\/angel drainer and then are split between the admin and the drainer customer.](https://preview.redd.it/cdnf6ecg2aif1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4ca74885f018b66a7769d1c0a539cf07b0100d)

the use of multiple transactions vs doing it all at once is also something i haven't seen before. this was done presumably to stay off the radar of anti-phishing efforts as well.

# how did this scam happen?

it appears this particular user most likely clicked on a fake aave eth link from a google search result. 

i looked at some community reported thefts coming from the inferno/angel admin wallet of 0x0be1c.....a144 and noticed similar patterns. all of the reported thefts appear to be coming from fake aave websites.

aave had an influx of scammer activity days after hitting the milestone of 60 billion in deposits since launch. the scammers used google ads to mimiic aave by creating a website with the same branding and made it look as ""official as possible"".

[above is an example of a malicious website targeting users who search for \\""aave\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7u1tugmh5aif1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dad12d2d9399cac8e5abef91cb38314b8b2ab6)

unfortunately, these malicious ads tend to be on the top of the google search results for terms like ""aave"" or ""aave smart contract"". 

the user who lost 343k may of been searching for the official aave website and came across a similar one that clearly was a scam. 

once token approval access was given, the aethweth was quickly moved to the malicious contract and the stolen funds were split between inferno/angel drainer and the customer.

# following the funds

as of this moment, the user's stolen crypto is all accounted for. inside the inferno/angel admin wallet, the aethweth was swapped to eth where it currently sits. these funds will eventually get siphoned off to other wallets controlled by inferno/angel, laundered, and then hit a deposit address.

whenever a large amount of crypto is moved to the customer's wallet, they tend to move the funds very quickly. all of the aethweth here was also swapped to eth and moved to the decentralized wallet of 0x38f3a4b7ed737fb64590be61fab5f11e74c3623d.

[above is a visualization of the funds from the user's wallet --\> malicious contract --\> drainer admin & customer wallets. so far no money laundering has taken place yet.](https://preview.redd.it/dzxb7dgzaaif1.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c6d2ffd92420de6503fe8f71cf6885f8a94bc01)

i'm sure there will be more movement of the funds in the coming days.

completely arbitrary. substantially pointless, given the technological and financial sophistication of most of their marketplace. i asked for an exception, and they denied it. i asked whether there was a person i could appeal this decision to, and got this:



""i understand your frustration. however, the $5,000 daily crypto withdrawal limit is a system-wide policy and cannot be appealed or manually adjusted by robinhood support or management. this limit is determined automatically based on account activity and verification, and there is no process to request an exception or appeal. you can continue transferring up to your daily limit until your full balance is moved. if you have questions about how to transfer or need help with the process, i’m here to assist.""

  
so if you're stacking at robinhood, and you're considering moving your crypto to self-custody (or anywhere!), be careful. you could be looking at months of daily transfers ahead of you if/when you shift.

imagine you’re locked in for the next 5+ years. no flipping, no panic selling, no chasing the next hype coin. you pick three altcoins… and that’s it. through bull runs, bear markets, and all the sideways boredom in between – you hold.

which three make the cut for you? and more importantly – why?

here’s my forever bag (at least for now):

1. ondo
yeah, i know it’s not everyone’s first thought, but hear me out. ondo is carving out a spot in real-world asset tokenization – basically bringing traditional finance products into the crypto world in a tokenized form. if this sector blows up (and i think it will), ondo could be right there at the front. it’s early, it’s risky, but i like the upside.

2. chainlink (link)
link is that quiet but critical infrastructure project. without oracles, defi as we know it just wouldn’t work. and link isn’t just sitting still – ccip (cross-chain interoperability protocol) could be massive for connecting different blockchains. in my eyes, link is like the plumbing of web3. not flashy, but essential.

3. ethereum (eth)
the og smart contract platform. eth is still where most of the action happens – defi, nfts, daos, you name it. with upgrades like the merge behind us and more scalability improvements coming, i think eth will keep its top spot for years. sure, competitors will pop up, but eth has that network effect and developer community that’s hard to beat.

⸻

now, i’m not saying these three are perfect. anything can happen in crypto. but when i think long-term, i like having a mix of:
	•	adoption potential (ondo)
	•	critical infrastructure (link)
	•	proven backbone (eth)

what about you? do you go safe with blue chips like eth, bnb, ada? or are you throwing darts at the next potential 100x microcap? maybe a mix – one safe bet, two moonshots?

i’d love to hear your reasoning. even if you think my picks are trash, tell me what you’d replace them with and why. bonus points if you’ve actually survived holding through a full bear market before – those war stories are always fun to read.

3. eth season is done and we have a situation where money flows from eth into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). there will be several cycles, not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump. alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping.
4. finally, once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

the latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into btc again. the alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ath (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

you also don't keep all of your converted btc when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for fiat (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. you can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 10-20% apy while your fiat gets you close to zero apy when you move it to your bankster's place.

once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy btc again because nobody is buying btc at atl except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top = ath hopefully) and finally 25% that's left for one last profit taking.

basically, you sell gradually at each local top of your favorite crypto and sell heavily +- 50% of your bag when you feel that this is gonna be as good as it gets (you'll never get the top so anything close to it = before and/or after ath is great).

i'll send an invoice to y'all later on, you can thank me later. ok, bye.

edit: i decided to use the comedy flair because most of you will fail, yet again, to follow the simple rules of profit taking, ending up being the exit liquidity + eternal bag holders. comedy and tragedy, a very thin line indeed.",0.9775,CryptoCurrency,636.0,154.0,1mn7vjs

from a user experience perspective, economic finality is what really matters, the point at which a transaction is so irreversible that it can be relied upon for financial settlement. this makes me wonder where block time actually fits in that bigger picture. does a shorter block time meaningfully reduce the time to finality, or is it overshadowed by other factors like network latency, consensus rounds, or validator performance?

i’ve been noticing a lot of people using block time as a headline metric when comparing “fastest” chains today. is that a fair or useful comparison, or should we be focusing more on end-to-end finality metrics instead? would love to hear perspectives from those who’ve worked on or benchmarked different networks.",0.2216,CryptoCurrency,8.0,5.0,1mnavyc

we don’t know exactly when a powerful enough quantum computer will be built, but it’s clear that it will happen sooner or later. most current blockchains, including bitcoin and ethereum, would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. efforts are underway to upgrade these blockchains, but it’s a challenging process that will take time — and there’s no guarantee the fixes will be ready before the threat becomes real.

it’s worth noting that there are already post-quantum cryptocurrencies designed to withstand this risk from the start. they use quantum-safe signature schemes like xmss or sphincs+, which cannot be broken by shor’s algorithm. a few of these coins are live today, but most are only available on small, niche exchanges with low liquidity.  


**questions for you:**

1. should quantum-resistant cryptos be listed on tier 1 exchanges like binance, coinbase, or kraken?   
a) yes  
b) no

2. after such a listing, i would:  
a) stick to mainstream crypto only, so no impact to me.  
b) add quantum-resistant crypto to my portfolio as a hedge against a black swan event.  
c) focus only on holding a post-quantum crypto portfolio.  
d) no impact to me, as i already own some from a smaller exchange.

computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name, or legal identity, of the other. interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. these developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

the technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. the methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. the focus has until now been on academic conferences in europe and the u.s., conferences monitored closely by the national security agency. but only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. and the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. high-speed networks, isdn, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, ku-band transmitters, multi-mips personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

the state will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. an anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of cryptonet. but this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. and just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier west, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

a lot of people still stick to the old playbook, holding stablecoins, waiting for a big dip, then swooping in to buy their favorite assets cheap. but the game is changing and honestly a wise crypto holder needs to see that. these days, stables aren’t just a parking spot anymore. they can actually work harder than some of the hyped tokens out there.  
  
right now, just holding some of it in spot account ( like normal bitget spot or maybe bybit) gives up 10% apr. that’s without doing anything extra. and if you happen to hit $500 in daily trading volume, that rate can climb to 15% apr.  
  
as for how companies like circle, the usdc issuer, make money, it’s simple. when you give them a dollar for usdc, they hold that dollar or a safe equivalent like treasury bills. those dollars can earn interest in traditional financial markets, and that interest is part of their profit. you still get your 1:1 peg, they get yield from the reserve.  
  
so the point isn’t that stablecoins are better than dollars, it’s that they give you flexibility. you can hold them, earn on them, trade with them instantly, or send them anywhere in the world in seconds without touching a bank. and if you play it right, like with many of them like $usdt, $usdc or $gho yield options in some exchanges, your patience in crypto doesn’t have to mean sitting still. your stack can grow in the background so that when the time comes to act, you’re stepping in with more than you started with. personally, i see the promise, but i’m cautious. a lot of what’s happening right now still feels tied to timing, hype, and market mood rather than consistent performance. the tech is interesting, but i’m not sure yet if it’s a lasting structural shift or just the newest narrative running its course.",0.9961,CryptoMarkets,4.0,3.0,1mnoxi7

this brings me to my dilemma: **what should i do with the 10% that was previously going into my savings account each month?**

1. keep building my fiat position for even greater security?
2. use that amount to accelerate my bitcoin accumulation, perhaps with a strategy that's a bit more active than standard dca?

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, samson mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

secomd, willy woo called bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

the real question isn't whether eth can pump another 12% to hit its ath. it's whether bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. and for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype.",0.9685,CryptoMarkets,13.0,2.0,1mnw5pl
