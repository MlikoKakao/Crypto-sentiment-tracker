given the size of this transaction, i’m wondering how likely it is that this wallet owner will try to sell all of that xmr back into btc or other assets anytime soon. a mass sell-off of that magnitude would almost certainly cause a severe crash in the xmr price due to liquidity constraints.

alternatively, is it more plausible that the owner will hold the xmr for the long term or gradually liquidate in small amounts to avoid impacting the market?

at this point i'm pretty sure we're in the top 10 of merchants doing most crypto payments with >5000 transactions last month alone. try us out for free by replying here (i'll send you an invite), or just [visit the website](https://nano-gpt.com/) and deposit as little as $0.10.

## july payment statistics

we added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. monero

we have to start with **monero**.

it's eating up everything else in our pie chart. xmr now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

genuine props to the monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. nano

second biggest is once again **nano**. our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

it's also being integrated into btcpayserver right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the lightning network.

average btc transaction size was $24.48, while lightning's was $4.42. as expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. litecoin

digital silver **litecoin** plus the recently added litecoin mweb added up to 6.7%.

6.59% litecoin, 0.11% specifically mweb.

to be fair - we only added mweb payments about 7 days ago! read the blog for more on our mweb integration.

# honorable mention: zcash

finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **zcash** with 3.44%.

all the more remarkable given that zec payments were only added 2 weeks ago, and the much-requested shielded pay-in addresses a few days ago. 

# the full data

here's the complete breakdown for all coins:

* xmr: 52.91%
* xno: 17.71%
* btc: 10.20%
* ltc: 6.59%
* eth: 3.57%
* zec: 3.44%
* verse: 2.35%
* sol: 1.08%
* btc-ln: 0.95%
* doge: 0.32%
* bch: 0.32%
* dash: 0.24%
* ban: 0.12%
* ltc-mweb: 0.11%
* kas: 0.05%
* egld: 0.01%
* pol: 0.01%

# kaspa, multiversx, dash, bitcoin cash

unfortunately as you can see kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

we know there are a lot of kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some kaspa people to hear how we can let kaspians know we exist!

another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was multiversx, with just 0.01% of total usage.

we know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in multiversx can get us on a podcast to explain nanogpt, we're all ears!

in a similar vein the typical payment coins like bitcoin cash and dash do not see the amount of usage on nanogpt that you would expect. we clearly need to up our outreach there!

that's all for now - any questions we are of course happy to answer. and if you want to also read about some nanogpt updates, read the comment below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1micqkz/crypto_payment_statistics_from_5000_transactions/,26,13,1micqkz,reddit,0.9948,290.69846118015124
2025-08-05 19:34:13,"how qubic fakes its monero hashrate qubic shills like to use a [website ](https://explorer.jetskipool.ai/xmr-tracker.html)(that is related to qubic, so no credibility at all) to show their ""progress"" in their 51% attack. yesterday, this website showed qubic at close to 50% hashrate, and now at 32%. the army of bots on x are quick to push this narrative as a ""proof"" that the attack works and qubic is ""just about"" to cross the 51% line.

well, this is all false. monero is fine.

the correct way to calculate qubic's hashrate is to go on [this website ](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero)and subtract ""hashrate"" from ""network hashrate"". this way, we can see the ""unknown"" hashrate from qubic, since it does not share its api anymore.right now, network hashrate is 5.15 gh/s and the pools are reporting 4.57 gh/s. this mean that everyone else, solo miners or unknown pools, and qubic, get a maximum of 0.58 gh/s (5.15 - 4.57), which is **11.4%** of hashrate (0.58 / 5.15).

by using this correct way of calculating the hashrate, qubic never went over 25% yesterday and even then it couldn't sustain this hashrate for more than a couple of minutes.

qubic mined only 160 of the last 1000 blocks, an average of 16%. we are far, really really far from a 51% attack.

2025-08-12 06:18:24,"stop the government taking a cut if you actually believe in free markets, monero isn’t optional, it’s a tool.

everyone loves to talk about “financial freedom” and “free markets” but most of you are still sitting with coins on exchanges, doing your taxes and trusting the same government you say you hate.

if you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, monero is how you actually do it.

so you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it’s now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. they took zero risk in that trade. when banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. when you win, they take a cut. when you lose, they vanish.

monero fixes that. nobody knows your 50 bucks of btc turned into 2k if you swap through monero. no blockchain trail, no reporting, no “oops, i forgot to declare my gains” with your name all over a public ledger.

and for those who support drug legalization… you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren’t using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you’re just talking. monero enables that market today.

when talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. they'll say “oh it’s only a small percent of the volume” or “fiat is worse.” screw that. the answer should be “fuck yes it’s used for this, that’s the point” and “fuck taxes, fuck government overreach” and “what does your shitcoin do for the average person?”

we took the risk with crypto, it could have gone to zero. the government didn’t take the risk, so they don’t deserve a reward. they’ll never bail us out, so why are we letting them cash in when we win?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mo1345/stop_the_government_taking_a_cut/,5,71,1mo1345,reddit,0.168,259.2676890546657

2025-08-12 20:50:05,"mining malincentives, withdraw shutdowns, price hits, and alt season let's take a deeper dive into what's likely happening with exchanges, xmr withdraw shutdowns, price attacks, mining malincentives, and how they're all interrelated.

1. background. we proved with a smoking gun that exchanges were fractional reserve xmr 2021-2024, as a means of price suppression. that gun was the repeated, long-running shutdown of withdraws from major exchanges, particularly when even minor pressure was applied against withdraws.

they have a history of doing this.

2. but how did binance and others cover their xmr shortfall into eventual delisting? **mining** it was no accident that nicehash shutdown xmr withdraws simultaneous with binance in 2021. howard chu also showed that the bitmain xmr miner came online about the same time. an extremely unprofitable miner.

3. so then, it's clear that exchanges are willing to price attack monero, sell fake xmr, shut down withdraws, and pay the difference on the backend in the mining ecosystem. why? because they have a financial incentive in a bull market to suppress xmr, and encourage plebs to buy the shitcoins they printed for free.

4. these qubic mining antics costs them money. they'd earn more rewards by behaving normally. **they're not acting in their own best _mining_ economic interests.**

the incentives for why they would act this way don't seem to make sense, until you realize that...

5. they're paying pool rewards in their own token. a token listed by the same exchanges that shuttered xmr withdraws. a token that they can artificially prop up to create malincentives for miners, and subsidize their fraud against customers with xmr on their exchanges. a token listed by binance and others with a history of fraud in more ways than you realize.

summary
i believe exchanges are propping up qubic tokens as an economic subsidy hoping to gain enough hashrate to disrupt the network, simultaneous with a strike against xmr price, and a coordinated bot/fear campaign.

while this might appear on the surface to be against their economic interest, it's a small price to pay to fud digital freedom money while they engage in another alt season, where they hope you'll buy their shitcoins instead of monero.

you can tell them to go f*ck themselves by mining, buying, and using monero.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mokkt2/mining_malincentives_withdraw_shutdowns_price/,7,1,1mokkt2,reddit,0.983,257.7180252196908

2025-08-13 02:26:51,"psa: qubic is lying. they don't have >50% hash rate. don't fall for it. as long as we as a community don't fall for it, qubic will lose.

qubic has been making a lot of noise over the past couple days about supposedly reaching over 50% of monero's hashrate. this means that they can, supposedly, take control of the network through a 51% attack by orphaning all other pools' blocks.

but qubic is bluffing.

they do not have over 50% of the network's hashrate. their entire attack plan is to convince miners that they are capable of pulling off a 51% attack, and to use the threat of lost profits to make miners switch from other pools to theirs. if they are successful in this disinformation campaign, they might convince enough miners to switch so that they do actually have over 50% hashrate. then, they actually could pull off a 51% attack.

do not fall for it.

in reality, qubic had roughly 35-40% of the network's hashrate at that point. at the time of writing, it has actually declined to about 30%, but that's not the point. that's still a lot, but it's not nearly enough to do a 51% attack. they'd have needed to increase their hashrate by 50% or more in order to be capable of a 51% attack.1

let's talk about why they were able to mine the majority of blocks despite not having the majority of hashrate. qubic was using a technique called ""selfish mining"", which is basically a technique that temporarily hides your mined blocks from the rest of the network in order to gain a competitive advantage. using this strategy, you can mine a lot higher percentage of blocks than you could by mining fairly. this is how they were able to mine the majority of blocks for a period during their previous ""mining marathon"" despite not having the majority of the network's hashrate. here is a more detailed explanation.

according to miningpoolstats and xmrwatch, at the time of qubic supposedly surpassing 50% of the network's hashrate, all of the known non-qubic monero pools had a combined hashrate of about 4 gh/s.2 you can verify this, though it may take some time, by manually adding up each pool's hashrate. in contrast, per jetskipool and qubicdesciple, qubic had about 2.5 gh/s. meaning that qubic had roughly 38% of the network's total hashpower (~6.5 gh/s) at that time. even with a minority of hashrate, selfish mining still allows them way more blocks than expected, especially when they get lucky3:

qubic shills keep spamming that they now have 51% of the network in their palm, and that miners need to switch over now to avoid losing money. but the reason they're so desperate for miners is switch is precisely because they don't have 51% of the network's hashpower, but want to have it in time for the attack.

as for why sites like jetskipool were showing >50% network share at that time, their calculated total network hashrate (less than 5 gh/s) was inaccurate for two reasons. first, that total is a moving average, and takes time to adjust when they turned their miners back on, meaning that the estimate was much lower (and their percentage much higher) than it actually was. secondly, and more importantly, due to selfish mining, a lot of both qubic and non-qubic blocks were never included in the blockchain due to failed or successful selfish mining incidents, respectively. since they were never included in the blockchain, these blocks' work is not added to the total estimated network hashrate, again making their share of the network's total hashrate appear much higher than it actually was. the qubic devs are aware of these factors, but their attack relies on people not knowing this. sites like these are what they use to lie. it's all part of their scare tactic.

this attempted attack is not sustainable. qubic is burning a lot of money on this, and it has a halving in just over a week from now, which will cripple its ability to keep payrolling it. that doesn't mean we'll be out of the woods, but they're currently at the height of their power, which is why they're so desperate to pull off an attack in time. they weren't even able to maintain their selfish mining! during their most recent ""monero mining marathon"", the one where they claim they achieved 51% of hashrate, they actually only mined about 36% of blocks total.

qubic will only win if people believe their lies.

don't fall for it.

with that all being said, they are still a threat. they can only win if they're able to convince enough miners that they've already won, which they haven't. if you aren't already, start mining solo, on p2pool, or really any other pool besides qubic.

notes:

this is more than you'd think, since increasing their hashrate also increases the network's total hashrate. think of it like this: assume they had 40% of the network's hashrate, meaning they had 4 out of 10 ""shares"" of the network's hashrate, meaning that all other miners combined had 6. they would need to surpass those 6 shares' worth, which is about 50% higher than their 4. if they were to obtain 2 extra shares, then the network would have had 12 shares total, leaving them with 50% of the total hashrate. if we instead assume that they have 30% hashrate (this is the case at the time of writing), then they acutally need more than double their current hashrate.

qubic shows up as ""unknown"" on miningpoolstats, because they stopped publicly reporting their hashrate. they specifically did this to obfuscate how much hash power they really have. qubic's hashrate is still available through the other sources mentioned, but they want to avoid it being easily visible and comparable to other pools, since that would expose their lies.

random variation plays a huge role in mining, meaning that miners can find way more or way less blocks than expected over a short enough timeframe. qubic's luck in any given 100 block window varied wildly from 21% up to the high 40's percent. either way, they are not even close to sustaining a 51% attack.",https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/1mod130/psa_qubic_is_lying_they_dont_have_50_hash_rate/,213,36,1mosfyp,reddit,-0.9918,250.28873217892945

2025-08-13 15:26:52,"the crypto bull market hasn't even gone full parabolic yet. here's what could help fuel a major melt-up: previous bull markets have all gone parabolic. because they recovered from a crash into oblivion. it's the nature of a volatile market.

if you get oversold price action that crashes into oblivion, then when the market recovers and is well gain, you can get insane over-buying as a natural reaction. kind of like ""for every action, there is an opposite reaction"".

then the insane melt-up crashes back down. rinse and repeat.

every cycle has had its final months go into a fomo run, then a mania melt-up into parabolic price action.

it's hard to say yet. we could be somewhere in between these two sides of the spectrum:

1- we could be on the very flatline before a major parabolic melt-up that will dwarf all this year's price action.

2- or this could be a milder melt-up like 2021, and we could be already more than halfway into a milder parabolic run.

# what perfect storm of events could help fuel a melt-up?

**-fear desensitization: heavy market fear for over a year, but with no consequences as the price still gets new aths:**

first off, it always helps when the market has already had most of its major fear out of the way.

and it might even have been increasingly desensitized from fear.

the market has already gone through months in recent years of fears of threats of nuclear war, major recession, tariff wars, covid variants, economic trouble all around the world, along with monthly crypto fud we had for over a year, from the crypto banking collapse to the recent xmr fear of a 51% attack. it's been one after another.

there's been an overload of fear, now mostly blown over, that will make it difficult to out-do.

it might even turn into a boy who cried wolf situation, even if there is legitimate fear coming up.

especially now that people see that despite all the fear we had, it didn't stop bitcoin from going past $120k.

**-m1 m2 money supply** has been climbing more sharply, and is forecast to continue this trend. while bitcoin has been falling behind. this is probably the trend that the crypto market has loved following the most, historically.

**-fed rate cuts.**

fed cuts haven't even started yet. it's unlikely we have even seen the biggest gains yet without any cuts started.

**- crypto etfs, 401ks, sovereign funds, coporate funds, etc...**

there's more and more of these big funds loading up on crypto. and some have only just started. it's starting to also look like they might be moving into alts also.

**-continuously pro-crypto us government, along with other nations warming up to crypto.**

the us government has continued its pro-crypto policies, as seen with its most recent bills to help the crypto space. but if you look around the world, it's not the only government that's increasingly more pro-crypto. one interesting area are the gulf states, which haven't been talked about much, but seem to be increasingly pro-crypto, and are rumored to be working on their own crypto sovereign funds.

**-fud and negative narratives are fading from mainstream media, and getting increasingly replaced by hype.**

there is still the occasional fud story, but if you look at when mainstream media has talked about crypto these past months, it's decreasingly less about ""scam"" and ""criminal money"" narratives, and increasingly more about ""big gains"", ""bull market"", ""technology"", ""pro-crypto policies"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mp7itl/the_crypto_bull_market_hasnt_even_gone_full/,296,87,1mp7itl,reddit,-0.9969,254.68909550237169
