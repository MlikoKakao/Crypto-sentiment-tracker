chainlink proving once again how its unified platform approach (data + cross-chain) provides the necessary rails to connect tradfi institutions to public/private chains

this latest collaboration involved anz bank, fidelity international, and chainlink under the hong kong monetary authority (hkma)'s e-hkd pilot programme phase 2 (hong kong dollar cbdc)

this initiative enabled the cross-chain payment-vs-payment (pvp) trade settlement of a bank-issued stablecoin (a$dc) on a permissioned chain (anz daschain) against a cbdc (e-hkd) on a public blockchain (ethereum sepolia) 

this lays the foundation for the expanded focus on a delivery-vs-payment (dvp) workflow involving the purchase of a tokenized money market fund using the e-hkd cbdc

chainlink services involved in this initiative include:

cross-chain interoperability protocol (ccip): infra that enables cross-chain transfer of value (tokens) and data (settlement instructions) between chains, enabling various pvp/dvp settlement workflows involving public (ethereum) and private (anz daschain) chains 

compliance services: a suite of compliance services for investor identity kyc/aml verification, turning anz's offchain identity registry into a reusable onchain identity credential (cross-chain identity) to facilitate compliance requirements 

digital transfer agent: onchain contract that automates nav updates, subscription/redemption workflows, and coordinates cross-chain movements of a tokenized fund that investors acquire after the pvp leg completes

you could always opt to not stake but then are you not effectively being punished against the many that are? or you when it comes to taxation you could always call singapore home like vitalik as you pay no income tax or capital gains tax on crypto... but for the vast majority this isn't feasible. currently if you're accumulating the likes of eth, you'd be sitting on a stack of eth watching a supply get diluted with ethereum rewards which if you don't take you miss out on and if you do receive you'll most likely receive a income tax bill, for an asset that you can't currently easily spend, hasn't been the greatest store of value recently and possibly face more taxation by ways of capital gains if you do. i'll elaborate further below but your tdlr for the moment is that whilst we're currently still in the adoption phase, retaining all the value within a crypto ecosystem system for growth such as bitcoin via pow is better store of  value and more tax efficient as more often than not the only tax due will be on disposal. until eth is treated, accepted and taxed like cash, i believe for the majority of retail investors staking rewards are more of a penalty against than a reward for and the resultant taxation a hindrance and minefield. 

__**further detail**__

for those unaware, two of the most dominant consensus mechanisms in crypto are: 

**proof of work** (pow) refers to a consensus mechanism used to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. it requires network participants, called miners, to expend computational effort to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. 

**proof-of-stake** (pos) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks to verify transactions and secure the network. it involves participants ""staking"" their cryptocurrency as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks. instead of relying on computational power like proof-of-work (pow), pos incentivizes validators to behave honestly and securely by rewarding them with tokens for their contributions.

today much of pow mining is almost on an industrial scale and competitive as it's difficult and expensive. whereas pos is (either directly or indirectly) is relatively easily and open to almost all. ultimately... pow it's very hard to be ""rewarded"" and only a minority are however with pos it's very easy and the majority ""rewarded"".

many have suggested that means staking isn't actually rewarding the majority, rather penalizing the minority who don't stake. as time goes on, i believe more and more will come to this conclusion. particularly when considering taxation which i'll touch on later.

__**bonus example**__

if your employer ""rewards"" you a one off bonus, it's often because they've made money. you feel it's a bonus because it's not been given, often unexpected, not routinely issued, subject to change and typically for a targeted minority.. it's proof of your hard work. 

if on the other hand your employer took some of their profits and gave almost everyone a reward, all of time, without them putting in the work, that was universal and routinely expected... then most would consider thats not a ""reward"" more like part of everyone's pay. in this system, is actually anyone being rewarded? surely those that don't accept/ or are paid the bonus are effectively being penalized for not accepting/ receiving it?


__**accumulation/ growth vs income**__

when it comes to investing, two main strategies are accumulation for growth or income.

**income investing** is a strategy focused on generating a consistent stream of income from investments, such as dividends from stocks, interest from bonds, or other interest-bearing accounts. the primary goal is to create a reliable cash flow that can supplement or replace other sources of income. 

**accumulation investing** is a strategy where any income generated by an investment (like dividends or interest) is reinvested back into the same investment rather than paid out as cash. this means the total value of your investment increases not just from the initial investment, but also from the compounding effect of reinvested income. 

at the corporate level businesses also do their own form of income/ growth investing. they can either pay out profits and reward shareholders by ways of dividend or they can keep and reinvest profits within the business and go for growth. 

in simple terms if we consider staking rewards like income and a system that doesn't pay out rewards like like growth/ price appreciation, when it comes to tech growth firms not paying a dividend and reinvesting profits has proved more economically streamlined and more tax advantageous. in very simple terms, you could argue this has been replicated with bitcoin price appreciation against the ethereums staking reward model. however unlike cash income which has real utility and often little or no tax, staking rewards have little utility and often subject to higher tax. 

ultimately i think whilst an amazing technical achievement and theoretically great, i don't think the ethereum community particularly vitalik paying tax at singapore rates has really fully appreciated the current economic and financial limitations that exist and pose in the near future. i believe this is the reason why my are seeing less value in some projects than more.",0.9997,2692.667938774116

2025-06-10 20:19:21,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1l897xe/why_are_people_still_bullish_on_projects_like/,"why are people still bullish on projects like nano and cardano, which are lauded for qualities they've had for nearly a decade, yet those qualities have led to near zero traction or adoption in that time? *disclaimer: not trying to fud ada or xno, they are just the best examples of this thinking that i've noticed. nothing against them, except i personally wouldn't invest in them at this point. if you disagree, this is the perfect opportunity to shill them, but if the shills are anything like the examples i've made below, i'd save em.*

**tldr: cardano and nano are both lauded for qualities they've possessed for many years, despite that they have both languished over those same years, so why would anyone expect them to positively change course now after nearly a decade of this? and at what point do you admit your investment thesis was wrong?**

in 2017-18, i understood the hype around them at that point. they, along with other projects, were promising alternatives to ethereum, bitcoin, litecoin, etc. they both had strong communities around them, as well as new tech stacks that were different and exciting.

but now in 2025, after a handful of years, what positive changes have we seen from them relative to the industry? what indication do we see that they are on the right track?

both have seen numerous protocol upgrades... but every protocol has as well, this is expected out of any project and not really a selling point in most cases. ""building through the bear market"" is not a badge of honor, it's table stakes.

beyond that, none of them have found anything resembling product market fit or any sustainable usage. both of them are largely the same as they were before. or at least they are being used almost in the entirely same manner and to the same degree. meanwhile, the rest of the industry started to adopt defi, stablecoin payments, and new tech stacks. stablecoins became the killer app of crypto and the trojan horse of the rwa trend. sub-second block times and sub-cent fees became the new goal for any chain.

it kind of feels like this:

---

* past nano shill: it's fast and free! a vastly cheaper and faster alternative to the few blockchains people use today, saving minutes and maybe hundreds of dollars of fees. most people are just buying and selling or sending a to b, so why not use nano?

* current nano shill: it's fast and free! a marginally cheaper and faster alternative to the the most popular blockchains people use today, saving maybe a fraction of a second or up to a few seconds and saving a fraction of a penny up to a few cents. but you can't send stablecoins through it... or any other assets... and there is no defi.

---

* past cardano shill: it uses eutxo, it uses haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has eth's co-founder. it's gonna take off when smart contracts launch!

* current cardano shill: it uses eutxo, it uses haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has eth's co-founder and it has smart contracts. it's gonna take off when leios/midgard/hydra/btcos/quantumhosky/onchaingovernance/whateverthenexthypedunderwhelmingthingis. stablecoins? umm sort of. defi? sort of. is it fast or cheap? faster and cheaper than ethl1, but slower and more expensive than most of the rest.

---

so the selling points are largely the same for both projects, but the industry around them have passed them by and neither of them have found footing in any of the emerging niches. nano is a payment coin but the most popular payment coins are overwhelming stables and cardano has had it's own troubles courting stablecoins. some people act like they don't want them, but to be a general purpose smart contract platform at this point without them, is asking for disaster. beyond that we're actually seeing heavy usage of a handful of chains. ethereum is *barely* inflationary at this point with the fees being burnt, solana is doing hundreds, if not thousands, of tps and keeping fees lower than cardano, doing single digit tps. so it's not just like the market is purely based on hype like it has been in the past, we actually have projects with real usage and revenue.

so, the way i see it is both cardano and nano are on a slow road to irrelevance unless something changes. whenever they are spoken about positively, it's almost *always* about a quality that they have possessed for many years, and rarely if ever is it anything it's currently doing. and if it's had those qualities that you think are so great, for so many years, then at what point do those qualities actually materialize something beneficial like actual demand/usage? at what point do you resign to the idea that you might have overvalued those things? and if you're going to respond with something as reductive as ""the market just hasn't realized it yet"" then at least try to explain how that could possibly happen, as if this subreddit possesses research capabilities beyond what the public can fathom...",0.9981,2767.2182897921757

i’ve always stayed away from moving into the ceo role because i’ve been focused on building pf as an institutionally governed foundation. but right now, polygon needs clear direction and focused execution and that means stepping up.

with a healthy treasury and several hundred million in cash, we’re in a great position to keep building for the long term, without any distractions or pressure to raise.

today, i’m announcing a series of much-needed changes designed to deliver greater value to pol stakers and bring increased clarity to the broader market.

1. we will depreciate polygon zkevm next year. polygon’s razor focus is going to be polygon pos and agglayer, nothing else. polygon pos will focus on stablecoin payments and rwas, while agglayer will focus on building a trustless internet of blockchains.
2. the first milestone of the polygon pos's gigagas roadmap is now live in testnet. this first upgrade pushes network capacity beyond 1,000 transactions per second early july and it's only the beginning. we already have the plan to move to zero reorgs and <1 second finality with >5000 tps achieved in a devnet enviornment. this will put polygon pos amongst the most performant blockchains by sept-oct timeframe. and beyond that, we have a clear path to scale to 100k+ tps over next few years. these upgrades massively increase the economic viability of polygon protocol and thereby the value for pol stakers.
3. agglayer v0.3 has been in the making and i am announcing week of june 30th as the rollout date. this version of agglayer is feature complete except fast interop which we anticipate to be completed by end of q3. we are back to massive shipping mode.
4. the agglayer breakout program will continue to spin off projects resulting in increased focus for polygon pos and agglayer and massive airdrops to pol stakers. we are in the business of building blockchain networks and zk is an important tool to bring that internet level scalability to blockchains. we have contributed a lot to zk and will continue to do so in a more neutral way by spinning out more of zk research efforts. next up is polygon zisk led by jordi baylina. more to come.
5. now that the sec has dropped its investigations and lawsuits related to matic as a security, which should have never existed given the nature of matic (and now pol), we are excited to see several large market makers coming back to the table in recent days to make markets in pol that strengthens the liquidity of pol on exchanges globally.
6. the foundation will also engage in educational campaigns to ensure everyone is aware of the upgrade of matic to pol.
7. bringing the polygon brand front and center into what was previously the neutral agglayer brand. it’s time to align the ecosystem more clearly and boldly under the polygon identity.

also, going forward, major announcements from polygon often will come from my twitter account, so follow me to be up to date and turn on your notifications.

so why am i doing this?

during 2021-22, we made a real effort to institutionalise the project by onboarding some amazing people as co-founders and board members and laying the foundation for scaling polygon from the 10-100 stage of a venture.

but little did i know, ethereum itself was going to go into an existential crisis that would pull polygon and the entire ethereum ecosystem right back to the 1-to-10 stage … or by some measures, even 0-to-1.

and the 0-to-1 stage is a different beast. it needs speed, courage to make bold bets, and the ability to handle failure. also, the crypto industry has changed from being research centric to user centric and polygon needs to change accordingly. institutional setups and board structures are great for stability, but they tend to produce average-case decisions — not the sharp, aggressive moves needed to deliver exponential outcomes.

polygon is now back as a zero to one startup setup. with the support of an incredible team at polygon labs, and strong leadership including marc, mudit gupta (cto), ryan (coo) and many others we are going to bring it.

let’s play!

i think this reignites the debate around the question of whether the blockchain is a place for immutability or for democracy—something that started with the dao hack and the etc/eth fork.

on one side, you have people who think that immutability of the blockchain is sacred, and that without it there is no security or trust in the blockchain. that we are essentially back to square one with an entity (or a group of entities) controlling and watching over our transactions. the exact thing that (they say) satoshi envisioned gone.

then on the other side, there are people who say that freezing and forking chains to prevent unwanted activity on the blockchain is perfectly decentralized, and adheres to the ideals of blockchain democracy; where each validator has a say in what they want to happen within the chain. without democracy, you could have rogue users or in this case—internet thieves—that will exploit the blockchain for purposes that are counterproductive to what the validators (people actually keeping the chain afloat) want.

i personally believe that somewhere in the middle there's a solution where a blockchain can run on democratic principles but at the same time, make it accessible and cheap to be a validator. if being a validator is expensive and inaccessible for 95% of the userbase, then it's like the users of the chain are being controlled by rich elites that—while do keep the chain afloat—may do things that the general userbase does not agree on. what do you think?",0.8655,2520.218966056777

* **simplicity**: slim down consensus, execution, and data layers to make it easier for new contributors to audit code.
* **optimality**: achieve lower latency and overhead, keeping ethereum competitive while maintaining decentralization.

2. there are not 17m + ""alt"" coins.  those are mostly memecoins or very specific use case driven projects leveraging blockchain concepts.  

3. as noted in the first bullet, 80% of the value is still in the top 10.  after about the top 1000, the value isn't worth talking about.  

  
4. if we have decided btc is the store of value, then it's fair to say many of the top 100 are more prepared to serve as a payment system, or deliver a business specific use case.  this means they aren't an alternative to btc, and they aren't competing for the same marketshare.    
  
5. smart contracts are an ""alternative"" concept- the added value to blockchain continues to evolve.  if this proves to be valuable enough within a store of value use case, then perhaps that is an ""altcoin"" directly competing with btc.

6. ""altseason"" 4 years ago mostly applied to ethereum and new coins.  now we have a wide variety of alts in the top 1000, all in different stages earning marketshare.  many top coins have higher marketcaps, so achieving 10x or more from those levels does seem challenging.  new coins face competition, and much greater scrutiny, so the percentage that breakout will not match the last cycle.

7. higher marketcaps? this doesn't mean they are sitting near all time highs - some are though!  it means many are sitting at higher lows than 4 years ago.  btw, if you are achieving higher lows, that does not mean you are disappearing, that means you are growing.  a common talking point is these projects are disappearing, which simply is not true. 

8. calling any alt a ""shitcoin"" is a pathetic attack which ignores the potential value of using the technology.  just a reminder, they are building upon the same concepts btc leverages.  more folks believing in blockchain tech strengthens the space, including btc.  it would be good to see open discussion again about what is being achieved with the mindset that not everything is a threat to your investment.

in summary- while the narratives attack altcoins, they really aren't hurting btc investments.  there is a variety of market opportunity that btc is not suited for.  investing in altcoins is more challenging than 4 years ago- choosing from old and new, big and small.  but it is healthy and positive for the space overall if investment continues.",0.977,2542.343136243922

proof of stake networks have been around since 2012 with peercoin (hybrid pow + pos), blackcoin, and nxt being the earliest. since then, there have been numerous pos networks including cardano, algorand, ethereum, avalanche, cosmos, polkadot, tron, bsc, fantom, solana, iota.

some of these networks (nxt, peercoin, iota) are practically dead, and yet the proof of stake protocols of their consensus protocols have never failed. this shows that even with tiny security budgets and small amounts of staking, proof of stake networks have relatively strong security. 

**attacking pos inflicts too much self-damage to the attacker**

there's enough economic disincentive to attack a pos network that no one bothers majority-attacking these networks.

the cost of attacking these networks requires buying up a huge portion of the stake, which in turn drives up the cost of the cryptocurrency and the cost of attacking astronomically. there's often not enough liquidity to even execute an attack. attacking a pos network hurts the attacker since they have a stake, and their stake is usually locked up for a short period of time.

**attacking pow is comparatively cheap**

pow security is extremely expensive and has to be constantly maintained through honest mining, and it's still very inefficient at providing security. the moment the security budget runs low, it becomes very vulnerable to mining attacks.

when the security budget falls, miners leave, and the cost of gathering enough mining equipment to 51% attack a pow network is orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of cryptocurrency being protected by the network. goldfinger attacks and grief attacks have happened numerous times to pow networks.

**pos implementation vulnerabilities**

that's not to say that pos is invulnerable. there are some implementations of pos that are less secure than others.

some networks like cardano don't have lockup periods. not having a lockup period is a major security concern since the attacker can stake, attack, and then immediately sell. in addition, pos without slashing is convenient, but it's less secure than with slashing since attackers don't have to worry about misbehavior.

but even with less-secure designs, it's still much more secure than pow. the attacker would need to magically find enough buyers on the market to sell 10-50% of the entire marketcap. and after the attacker sells, the network would go back to being secure. it's a very expensive cost to briefly censor a network. it's completely impractical when there are easier pow targets to go after.",-0.9533,2542.82603574146

it aims to demonstrate that decentralized blockchains can serve humanity in other ways than just with transactions.

it invites you to think of new ways of law creation outside existing jurisdictions.



# the decentralized bill of liberties

**preamble**

whereas all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and are endowed with reason and conscience, they should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood,

considering that the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

recognizing that modern technology unites humanity across borders,

observing that cross-border technology and governance both pose opportunities and challenges to individual freedoms to act,

acknowledging that liberties, as fundamental rights, protect individual freedoms to act,

affirming that liberties limit all forms of human governance and create a universal duty of respect for all persons and institutions—without granting authority to create obligations beyond their original scope,

realizing the need for a bill of liberties that transcends jurisdictional limitations while applying equally to all,

**creating an immutable record of the following universal liberties:**

**article 1** every human being has the right to life, liberty, and the security of person, to bodily integrity, and to freedom from medical and scientific procedures without consent.

**article 2** every human being has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion and to participate in cultural life, arts, and technological and scientific advancement.

**article 3** all human beings must be secure in their family, home, and correspondence; be free from attacks upon their honor and reputation; and have the right to privacy.

**article 4** all human beings are free to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, and to use their preferred language. all men and women are free and protected in founding and raising a family.

**article 5** every human being has the right to freedom of opinion and expression and to freely obtain and share information regardless of medium.

**article 6** every human being has the right to work and engage in economic activity; to acquire, own, use, and exchange property; and to transact freely in a medium of exchange of choice.

**article 7** every human being has the right to assembly and association and to organize with others to pursue and protect their mutual interests.

**article 8** every human being has the right to freedom of movement and residence.

**article 9** every human being has the right to self-determination, to dignity, to pursue education, and to the free development of personality.

**article 10** no human being may be subjected to slavery or servitude, to torture, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, or to sexual violence or exploitation.

**requirements of all legal systems**

all human beings have a right to a legal order where they are treated as equals before the law, enjoy equal protection from rights violations and arbitrary arrest or detention, and have an effective remedy against rights violations.

no one may be deprived of any liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as established by law, and no one may be held guilty of any penal offense which did not constitute a penal offense at the time when it was committed.

everyone charged with a penal offense has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, and impartial judiciary system; and, when deprived of their liberty, be treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.



# 🤔 why do we need a bill of liberties?

the decentralized bill of liberties addresses a critical gap in our legal frameworks.

despite the widespread acceptance of human rights principles, modern legal systems were designed for centralized structures and struggle to accommodate decentralized technologies.

as threats to liberty evolve beyond nation-states to include international institutions, debt-based financial systems, ngos, and cross-border technology, we need a bill of rights that:

* protects all humans equally
* exists independently of institutions
* is not a codification of ideology
* does not treat individuals as means to an end
* exists separately from (supra)national governing layers

# 🔧 potential applications

the decentralized bill of liberties can be implemented in various contexts:

* **moral compass** for participants in decentralized networks to assess behavior, regulations, and technologies.
* **foundation for social smart contracts** \- daos, network states, or other decentralized law instruments can ""call"" the dbol during creation.
* **objective legal standard** for blockchain projects and ai.
* **inspiration** for citizens of countries that currently lack a bill of rights
* **""prenuptial agreement""** for social contracts, establishing clear boundaries between collective rule and individual liberty

as you can see in the image above big players are not just whispering about ethereum, they are jumping in full throttle and you know what will happen once they believe they have already enough eth right? they will start shilling it to make the price fly to the sky.

some of those that are going crazy into ethereum are:

* **blackrock,** the world's largest asset manager that is dipping its toes in eth. this is a signal that crypto is not just a fringe bet anymore. when blackrock moves, markets listen.
* **paypal**: they adopted crypto and they are making buying, selling and holding crypto super accessible for millions. (not for me, i prefer doing it myself but i am sure a lot of people will use it). ethereum is starting to be the core bridging traditional finance with defi.
* **franklin templeton**: a huge global investment giant that is getting serious about blockchain tech that means that the old guard recognizes ethereum potential.
* **wisdomtree**: innovators in asset management. they have launched ethereum etfs making it easier than ever for investors to get exposure to eth without having to manage wallets or keys. not for me but for sure attractive to other kind of investors
* **coinbase**: leading crypto exchange that is building around ethereum ecosystem supporting base for example and supporting defi, nfts and everything in between.

and this is just the surface. the list goes on and on. ethereum is an sleeping giant that will surprise a lot of people that are losing faith on this project because of the price.

fortune favors the patient.

\*\*\* disclaimer \*\*\*

this post is not intended to talk shit about certain coins, i'm investing in most of these coins and wish every coin and every investor to succeed. i just want to point out a few reasons why tech doesn't always beat lower tech.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


  
  
you look at these crypto projects with brilliant tech, coins like monero, nano, algorand, stellar, and iota that promise to be faster, cheaper,  more private, or more scalable. yet, you see them getting absolutely left in the dust by coins that, let's be honest, started as a joke or have worse tech.

so, why does a coin with a dog on it outperform genuinely innovative technology? it's because in the wild west of crypto, the best tech doesn't always win.   


**simplicity and a ""shareable"" coin beats a technical whitepaper every time**

*  let’s face it, the crypto market runs on hype. it’s driven by emotion, speculation, and the fear of missing out. for the average person looking to invest, they do not care about a coins tech nor are able to understand it. ""it's a fun and cheap dog coin that might make you rich"" is a much easier story to get behind than trying to understand the nuances of a directed acyclic graph (dag), tangle or a pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  tech coins struggle because their value proposition is complex. they’re trying to sell you the blueprints for a skyscraper, while meme coins are selling you a lottery ticket with a funny dog on it. the lottery ticket is just more exciting and a lot easier to understand. this simple, viral narrative, often supercharged by a celebrity tweet, creates a powerful wave of momentum that has very little to do with fundamentals.



**an highly advanced ghost town vs a thriving metropolis** 

* imagine building the most advanced city in the world with perfect roads, but nobody moves in. that’s the challenge many tech-focused coins face. they have incredible infrastructure, but they lack the most important thing: people.  ethereum, for all its talk of high fees and slow speeds, won the early race because it built a massive, thriving ecosystem. developers flocked to it, creating a universe of apps, nfts, and defi platforms. a new blockchain, even if it's technically better, has the monumental task of convincing everyone to leave that bustling metropolis and move to their new, empty city.



**the problem of being too good** 

* sometimes, a coin's best feature can also be its biggest weakness. take monero (xmr). its privacy technology is unmatched, which is fantastic for users who value anonymity. but that same feature makes regulators nervous, leading to it being kicked off major exchanges. if people can't easily buy your coin, its growth is naturally going to be stunted.



**price of a coin > market cap**  
then you have the raw numbers, which can be mind-boggling. it's often not just about the total value of the network (market cap), but rather the perceived ""cheapness"" of a coin's individual price. many new investors mistakenly believe a coin priced at, say, $0.000001 has far more potential to skyrocket than a coin priced at $100. they don't always understand that market capitalization – the total value of all circulating coins (price per coin multiplied by the number of coins in circulation) – is the true indicator of a project's overall size and value.

  


**fomo & marketing**

* ultimately, the market is made of people, and people are driven by psychology. the fear of missing out (fomo) when a coin is skyrocketing is a far more powerful motivator than a well-written technical document.
* coins with ""worse"" tech often win because they are more accessible. they get listed on every major exchange, they're easy to buy, and the high trading volume means you can get in and out quickly. they build massive, passionate communities who act as a free, 24/7 marketing army.



while superior technology is crucial for long-term survival and building the future of finance, the short-to-medium term game is all about narrative, community, and pure speculative energy. for now, a good story is worth more than good code.



  
**tl;dr**

* **hype & simplicity > technology:** the crypto market is driven by hype. a simple, viral story like ""funny dog coin"" is easier for new investors to grasp and get excited about than complex tech.
* **hype & fomo:** meme coins generate massive ""fear of missing out,"" leading to speculative frenzies that have little to do with the coin's actual utility or technology.
* **the power of community:** coins like dogecoin and shiba inu have huge, passionate communities that create free, viral marketing, while tech coin communities are often smaller and more insular.
* **accessibility is key:** ""worse tech"" coins are often easier to buy on popular exchanges, making them more accessible to the average person. advanced coins can be harder to find and use.
* **empty cathedral problem:** a network can have the best technology in the world, but without a large, active ecosystem of users and developers (like ethereum has), it struggles to gain traction.
* **regulatory headwinds:** some advanced features, like monero's privacy, can attract negative attention from regulators, limiting their growth.",0.999,2515.92283869608
2025-06-16 08:37:42,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lcnmud/bitcoin_buying_timing_war_fears_and_market/,"bitcoin buying timing: war fears and market recovery analysis the market has been rattled once more by rising tensions between iran and israel. this news was enough to shake the entire asset market, including cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin briefly threatening the $100,000 mark and altcoins facing steep corrections. it’s a familiar scene—one of recurring fear and doubt. but what does it all truly mean?

looking back, similar conflicts unfolded in april and october 2024. the market reacted with momentary panic and a surge in selling, only to recover swiftly within days. this time appears no different. **the fact that fear hasn’t lingered long suggests this is less a structural collapse and more a technical reaction.** it’s a clue that there’s more to this than just a price drop—something worth examining beneath the surface.

the iran-israel conflict has been limited to strategic airstrikes and restrained missile responses, without direct ground confrontation. this points to a localized skirmish rather than an all-out war, likely acting as an event that pauses the market’s existing rhythm rather than redefining its course. in other words, this uncertainty may fade within days rather than persist.

**this hints that, between collapse and counterattack, the latter is gaining traction**. meanwhile, ethereum is showing striking momentum, with trading volume and futures open interest hitting all-time highs, suggesting not just a technical bounce but a structural signal of institutional entry.

https://preview.redd.it/2tuvu7pk397f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=79607c04fc202d58fb737a40519c06c54963873a

  
the eth/btc ratio further confirms ethereum’s relative strength, **shifting focus from short-term price swings to the potential for a broader transition.**

the altcoin market tells a bigger story. the others market cap chart shows it breaking out of a months-long downtrend, now digesting consolidation in the phase d zone. if this level holds, a return to an upward cycle seems plausible.

[a chart depicting others market capitalization](https://preview.redd.it/9pawsexm397f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a154354aa5a8dd2ef33bdc735a64d753f37c8af6)



**this isn’t a mere bearish turn but a retest of the upper boundary of the prior downtrend channel—a technical validation of support.**

[a chart depicting total3](https://preview.redd.it/24faw2zp397f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d2f55a4b8ae38f90b80b590c4e9324fba1b8ebc)

  
the total3 index reinforces this, with the altcoin market’s cycle of surge, correction, support confirmation, and rebreakout still intact, currently poised for its next expansion.

amid this, coinbase’s inclusion in the s&p 500 marks a symbolic shift. it’s not just a stock update—it’s a structural milestone for the cryptocurrency industry crossing into mainstream acceptance. wall street no longer sees digital assets as outliers but as candidates for integration. the door to institutionalization is opening.

ripple, meanwhile, has been quietly consolidating in a box range for 195 days. this prolonged stagnation could precede an explosive breakout in either direction, with the 2.08 level acting as a key support that, if held, might serve as a buying point.

ultimately, the market is swaying in uncertainty, but that uncertainty could fuel the next move. the pattern of war, fear, correction, and rebound has repeated through 2024 and now into june 2025. history suggests these dips often recover quickly, laying the groundwork for fresh rallies. rather than being paralyzed by fear, it might be worth reading the structure of the flow and preparing for what’s next. opportunities don’t come often, but when they do, they’re brief and potent. this could be one of those moments.",-0.9775,2628.308912104904

• sharplink gaming just bought $463 million worth of eth, becoming the largest public eth holder.  
• anthony pompliano is reportedly raising $750 million via a spac to buy bitcoin. yes, *that* pompliano — the one who was calling for $500k btc during the bear market.  
• btc hit $110,000 last tuesday — almost breaking its ath of $111,940 from may 22.

— on the other hand, the macro picture isn't so pretty:  
• israeli airstrikes on iran sent btc down 2.8% in 90 minutes. they can crash btc at any moment, all it takes is another hit.  
• last time, $427 million in long positions got wiped out. bulls took a hit, fast.

# so, can btc still reach $119,000 in this climate?

personally, i’m cautiously optimistic.

✓ the fundamentals are strong: institutional adoption, post-halving supply tightening, growing etf demand, and now spacs targeting btc.  
✗ but short-term moves are still dictated by geopolitics. and that’s not something even the whales can control.

so yes, $119k is possible — but timing it depends more on global stability than ta.

# what about ethereum?

eth is quietly building up momentum too:  
• sharplink staked over 95% of its eth — that’s a long-term move, not just speculation.  
• if this continues, a return to $4,000 feels realistic. not immediate, but definitely in sight — especially if the sec eases up.

what do you think?  
• can btc still hit $119k this year?  
• are we underestimating the impact of war and instability?  
• should eth be getting more attention right now?

one of the platforms i’ve tried is banana gu botn. it supports auto-sniping tokens the moment they launch, while also running safety checks like anti-rug, mev protection, and pre-buy simulations to see if the token is even sellable. it’s compatible with multiple chains like ethereum, solana, and blast. the interface is actually pretty simple, but the backend seems to be doing a lot in real time.

they also offer copy-trading features now, where you can automatically follow wallet activity from top-performing traders and set your own risk thresholds. that’s something i didn’t expect from a telegram bot, but it’s been interesting to test in parallel with my manual plays. i’m still cautious, though, i only use small amounts until i fully trust a token launch or trading flow.

just curious how others here approach early entries. are you mostly hunting through dexscreener and twitter, or have you tried automating with bots like this?",0.9652,2509.743187952874

i’m sharing this because i lived through it myself. here’s the full cycle of how justin yuchen sun and his team allegedly manipulate bttc on binance.

justin yuchen sun, aka fraudster, opened the second batch of short positions on #bttc.

he uses bots to open such large short positions on his chinese friend’s exchange called binance. the bttc price dropped from $0.00000063 to $0.00000057 in just two minutes (–9.52% price drop) while bitcoin and ethereum prices remained unchanged.

stop giving your hard-earned money to this chinese fraudster.
you can’t be faster than their bots.

bttc must be delisted from every country’s crypto exchange!

justin yuchen sun’s friend, changpeng zhao (cz), provides him space on binance to operate this fraud.
they’re both chinese and cover for each other’s actions. innocent people lose their savings because of their fraudulent schemes and market manipulations.

justin yuchen sun’s fraudulent plan on bttc works like this:

• short your own coin (bttc) using bots within two minutes — faster than any human trader. it must be fast because justin sun’s bots are programmed to sell to themselves instantly so that others must not have time to see or react or protect themselves against fraud.

• use your in-house bttc tokens to create psychological pressure via hidden sell walls in the order book or pre-programmed bot activity. this prevents others from pushing the price up. that’s why bttc doesn’t rise while justin sun is holding a short position.

• continue selling until there are no buyers left. this causes the price to drop further, ensuring justin’s short positions stay profitable — at the expense of innocent traders. at this stage, price no longer matters. it could even be $0.00000001. the goal is to trigger long position liquidations and drive the price down even more for maximum short profit.

• after artificially driving the price down, justin sun places massive buy orders at the bottom -not to pump the price, but to close his shorts at the lowest possible price, locking in maximum profit. then, at the same low and flat price level, he opens large long positions using the profits he just made, again via bots.

you’ve probably seen those $500,000 to $1,000,000 buy walls sitting at a single price level - those are not organic. these are short-closing and long-opening orders.

• at this point, he doesn’t immediately sell the bttc tokens he acquired through self-trading. instead, he keeps a large quantity of bttc in reserve. later, when the price rises, he sells those tokens at a much higher price for a second round of profit. if he doesn’t sell, he may use them as collateral to borrow other tokens or to manipulate the order book again with spoof orders. this way, he maximizes his total gain from both the short and long cycles, while never exposing himself to real risk.

once his long positions are set, his team removes spoofed sell orders from the order book. this tactic helps avoid buying from their own fake orders, allowing real orders to fill instead. once spoofed orders are removed, they rapidly begin the price surges. since bttc has a thin and illiquid market, it takes very little actual volume to push the price up. their bots start aggressively buying small amounts - and the price begins to climb.

as it rises, other traders’ short positions get liquidated, causing even more upward pressure. as it goes up, more traders’ short positions get liquidated, creating a chain reaction of forced buying and pushing the price even higher. this chain reaction of short liquidations accelerates the pump.
at this point, justin sun opens a new short position right at the top, where liquidity and optimism are highest - and the cycle repeats.

this is pure international market manipulation and fraud.

simple example of this fraud cycle:
-let’s say bttc is priced at $0.00000060.
justin sun opens a massive 10x leveraged short position on his own token, using bots on binance. but instead of selling to real traders, he sells the short position to himself using other bots under his control.

-then he spoofs the order book with large fake sell walls to scare traders and suppress price. people panic-sell, and bttc drops to lets say $0.00000045.

-he closes his short at this low price, making profit.
at the same time, he opens a large long position at the bottom using the money he just made.

-then he removes the fake sell orders, and uses bots to start pumping the price upward. since bttc has a thin order book, the price climbs fast. 

-other traders’ shorts start getting liquidated, causing a chain reaction of forced buys that pump the price even more.

-finally, when the price is high again, justin opens another short at the top, and the cycle repeats.

this way, he profits from both directions - shorting and longing - with minimal risk, because he controls both sides of the trade.

this is classic market manipulation, and in regulated markets it would be highly illegal.

justin yuchen sun lives in sentosa cove, singapore, in a luxury villa with a pool and an office where he and his team carry out this manipulation.
he lives like a princess using your hard-earned money.

changpeng zhao lives in a luxury apartment in a dubai skyscraper.

they are both involved in this international fraud scheme.
stay away from anything related to justin yuchen sun — bttc, trx, usdd, or any associated projects.

i hope this fraudster and his team get their karma.

i didn’t want to just throw money around so i started learning how to look into projects properly before touching them.  
the first thing i learned was how to check market cap. that just means how much the whole coin is worth. i figured out i could multiply the price of one coin by the total number of coins out there. that helped me understand if something was really valuable or just looked cheap.  
  
next, i always visit the project’s website. if it looks messy or doesn’t explain clearly what the coin is trying to do, i take that as a bad sign. i like to know what the coin is made for. is it just noise or is it solving something real?  
i also try to find out who created it. if the team is hiding their names and faces, i slow down. that kind of thing makes me uncomfortable in this space.  
  
then i look at the community. i check if people are active on twitter, telegram, reddit, and i try to see what they talk about. if it’s just price hype with no talk about what the project actually does, i lose interest.  
i also pay attention to the roadmap. that shows me what the team plans to do over time. are they testing things? do they have real updates ahead? if there’s no clear plan, i keep my distance.  
  
and finally, i check if they’re building anything useful or working with other known projects. when i see good partnerships or signs of real world use, i get more confident.  
  
that’s how i’ve been checking coins before putting my money in. it doesn’t mean i always win but it helps me avoid jumping into bad plays.  
  
hope this helps someone who's just starting like i once did. if anyone else has more tips feel free to drop them. i’m still learning too.",0.9701,2421.1861083984804

hi everyone, i’d like to share a difficult situation i’m facing with htx (formerly huobi).

in late 2024, i received 3 eth transactions from a long-time online contact as compensation for digital assistance and research. after converting the eth to usdt, i now have a balance of 4,461.45 usdt on htx. however, the platform froze my withdrawal and requested detailed documentation about the source of funds.

what’s confusing is:

only 2 out of the 3 transactions were flagged, even though all came from the same person.  
these transactions are now over 5 months old, with no reports, disputes, or legal claims.

i’ve lost contact with the sender, and htx continues to demand impossible proofs like their personal id and contract documents.

despite sending them identity verification, wallet ownership proofs, transaction history, and escalation letters, the restriction remains. i feel trapped in a loop of rejection without clarity.

i’m looking for advice or support from the community. has anyone dealt with similar issues? are there crypto user protection groups that might help?

thanks in advance.",-0.7592,2421.1861083984804

we’re the team behind teller -- a fixed-rate lending protocol built on ethereum. 

the difference between teller and traditional defi money markets, like aave or compound, is that teller loans are fixed-rate and time-based — similar to how a bank loan or line of credit works. 

this means instant liquidity for *any* erc20 with no margin-calls, no liquid-staking, and no impermanent loss. 

**sounds cool, but how does that work?** 

deposit = earn 💰 

anyone can create a lending pair on teller — the lender or pool creator sets the terms and then users can borrow against the assets provided. for example, borrowers can get $usdc for providing their $wbtc as collateral.

the yield that is earned by lenders is generated from the interest that is paid when borrowers repay their loans. 

when creating the pool, the lender sets the collateralization ratio (ltv), the loan duration, and the apr/apy of the pool. the pools are single exposure and the collateral risk is isolated to the pair. 

the apy of each pool is set to a range, usually between 20-60%. the current apy that is earned at any time is based on how much of the pools available liquidity is being utilized. 

for example: if no one is borrowing from the pool, then no yield is being generated — if 100% of the liquidity is being borrowed, then 60% yield is being generated. 

current teller yield opportunities: 

* usdc/wbtc -- 8.91% 
* usdc/masa -- 68.78% 
* usdc/spx -- 42.87%
* usdc/pixl -- 41.70%
* usdc/apu: -- 31.36%
* usdc/clanker: -- 38.96%

ready to start earning now?

click [here](https://app.teller.org/lend?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit_ama&utm_campaign=teller_reddit_ama_1) to checkout the pools.

deposit bitcoin or stables = earn 30%+ apy with no il. it’s as simple as that.

thanks for reading! we appreciate it.

and now for the ama...

the teller team is online to answer anything you’re wondering about: 

* what happens if i need more time to repay my loan?
* how does teller work without margin calls? 
* how does yield stay high without inflationary token rewards?
* what happens if a borrower defaults on their loan?

there are no more pigs left to slaughter since everyone became aware that crypto as a whole is a scam.

the belief system that made this industry work has completely collapsed.

at least in 2017 people actually believed in those crazy icos or whenever a new chain would come out.

there was genuine excitement, real conviction behind every project.

nowadays it's like: ""oh a new chain? wow another vc backed scam to dump on retail.""

the shift happened fast and it's permanent.

nobody believes in anything anymore, i respect the spx6900 community for trying to change that but sadly they have failed.

crypto topped in 2021. everyone i know peaked their nw then and since then it has been down only with no exceptions.

most of you just aren't willing to admit to it, respect to gainzy for actually doing so.

look at su zhu, he peaked at billions in 2021 but could barely make $40m this cycle.

people think pump fun is extractive but they have only managed to extract $700m this cycle.

those are rookie numbers if you compare it to opensea in 2021 who extracted billions.

we have gone from a gold rush to fighting over scraps, the only winners were vcs and exchange founders.

crypto can be compared to the japanese stock market in the 1980s. yes there's an ever expanding money supply globally, but it doesn't necessarily have to trickle down to crypto.

when there is an aging population, like there is now in crypto, that doesn't result in more buyers.

in fact, anyone who would have bought into crypto already has and lost all their money.

there are simply no new buyers and it makes sense, who keeps returning to the same casino that makes them lose every single time?

you need a few big wins occasionally to keep going, but what we have now are just people consistently losing.

bitcoin is the only exception and will survive since alts/btc is perma down only and won't reverse anytime soon. even vitalik knows ethereum is cooked.

i guess everyone knew that btc maxis were right but our thesis was that we could gamble and outperform btc with alts.

we were wrong.

crypto is dead as an industry, pack it up if you're trying to make money here. extract whatever you can and leave.

so guys.. when altcoin season??

i agree with what he said for the most part. bitcoin breaking 100k didn’t give us the altcoin season we were expecting.. i believe there is still life in this space.. but man it’s damn hard to make it in crypto now.. use to be $100 and a dream, now it seems like you need way more capital to make it big in this space. unless you’re god tier lucky, catching plays early and hodling out for big gains..

i’m personally taking a break from the space, need to pay down debt and losing money like i have been when i could be paying down debt doesn’t feel good.. hopefully when i’m back in a couple months markets are looking really good and alts are getting love again.

i think it's kind of funny that throughout these past 2 quarters there was always a different narrative to pump and dump coins throughout the market.

i know bitcoin is sucking up the liquidity of alts as it keeps trying to touch 110k but the alts are hardly budging, like a beaten animal - they're afraid to move. i understand we may still be under a bitcoin season but at this point altcoin sheepishness is becoming somewhat apparent as it isn't nearly moving as much as bitcoin is with enthusiasm. this is literally like trading with crumbs.

if bitcoin somehow manages to correct again like it did with the israel-iran conflict it's going suck up the value of altcoins as there's been macro negative divergence in all of crypto since january. i'm not sure i want to hold my coins when it touches back down to 85-95k. traditionally, ethereum is supposed to be the second hand to move to signal altcoin season but it's not moving much either. not sure what vitalik is up to these days or if we can reliably run on past graphs this time.

some people this month are banking on j. powell to say something about tax rate cuts next month but he does nothing but foam nothing burgers into existence. he says the job market's doing fine when there's probably someone out there working 3 jobs just to stay afloat. now he's sweating over the fact may be he should have cut rates in june as it may be too late to which could lead to a further descending action and liquidation, lol.

this growth reflects increasing user engagement, more wallets, more dapps, more protocols launching and more real utility being built. ethereum ecosystem is the go to ecosystem and this is just the beginning of a new era.

table of contents
🚨1. everyone else is speeding up
🔧2. shiny new tech, but nobody’s using it
📉3. people just aren’t talking about cardano anymore
so… should you still believe in cardano?

while cardano has seen investors disappointed over the last few years having lost market capitalisation to other newcomers like solana tron and even dogecoin,  it's not all doom and gloom. 

during bull runs cardano is usually very sluggish and slow to respond to bullish market conditions when all the other altcoins see spectacular gains. furthermore, announcements from either developers or the founder charles hoskinson usually disappoint and in some cases the price goes down when a new feature is released rather than going up. hoskinson in particular has a habit of announcing grand plans and long-term visionary projects, which either never materialize or simply get ignored by investors when released. one example is his work in ethiopia which was first trumpeted over 2 years ago and yet nothing has come of it. 

coin market cap chain analysis reveals that while ethereum has 639 projects in progress, cardano only has 18, despite being one of the oldest major cons. contrast that with newcomers like solana which already has 76 projects, and tron which already has 15 projects. 

cardano recently went live with a new governance scheme which was supposed to facilitate the community being able to influence policy and direction for ada. however despite this change, the way that cardano is being marketed and the failure to develop and innovative fast enough to keep pace with what investors and the markets are demanding is making it impossible for ada to retain market share and market capitalisation continuous to slide.

the coin's leadership remains obsessed with grand scale projects and makes announcements about releases which contribute to the coins ability to support wide scale adoption.

 unfortunately the developers appear to be out of touch with what the community needs or wants and therefore their announcements are usually met with a complete lack of interest, keeping the price low.

so what does the future hold? it shouldn't take much more market capitalisation slippage for the leadership team to realise that they are not in sync with what investors are looking for. and hopefully they will finally start to develop new features and functionality in a more agile way, meaning faster release turnaround and faster feedback from the markets on the directions that they may take or projects they may be embarked upon. 

this should mean that they would get away from the current situation where they work on features and projects for many years and then when the feature or project is finally released they discover that it was not something that investors or users were looking for and therefore the price doesn't react positively. 

cardano is built upon a very solid foundation, so it should be relatively easy for the leadership team to start to build on that in a way that inspires investor confidence.",0.9743,2427.0361280606835

yesterday, the app showed a transaction of the total amount in the account to ""eth-defi"" from which she cannot remove her funds. it is giving her some sort of 6 day countdown and it seems to be its own account in the app in which she can move the funds from eth to udsc within it but cannot withdraw out of this account to her original [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) wallet. every time she exchanges between the coins, a fee is collected.

she says she has not shared her 12-word phrase with anyone; however, her account address or hash or something was shared with someone she now knows to be a scammer. is it possible that this person took funds out of an account using just the account address? is this a separate scam? or did she just click something and just doesnt understand the platform well enough to withdraw?

i've been trying to read up on crypto stuff but i have zero experience with it and honestly cannot wrap my head around the whole thing, however i know that scams run absolutely rampant in the crypto world. i thought onchain and [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) were legit though... does anyone know anything that will be able to help her? do we just call it a day and accept the money is lost?



edit, these are her words:

i opened a crypto account and connected it to the onchain app. on the onchain, i signed up for a contract for mining on the app. they asked to connect the contract to the onchain wallet and hold the funds in custody while mining. every six hours, they generate a profit in ethereum which has to be exchanged back to usdc and can be withdrawn back into the wallet. after some profits were accumulated and i was withdrawing $100 every 6 hours, suddenly all the funds were sucked into the contract. i am unable to withdraw back into the wallet, but i can change the funds from usdc to eth and eth to usdc, but every time i do so, a fee is collected.",0.7186,2435.670179165772
2025-06-29 23:46:33,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lnt6ck/what_are_the_bear_arguments_against_litecoin/,"what are the bear arguments against litecoin? i’ve been doing some diligence on litecoin for a few days now, and i believe it’s extremely undervalued.

it’s literally a copy of bitcoin except there will be 84 million coins, but then with lower transaction fees and times.  the hashing algorithm is different, but it doesn’t seem to be in a bad way, just different.

litecoin has always been referenced as the silver to bitcoin’s gold.  the name is literally telling you it’s bitcoin light.  the purpose of it is to be more usable for spending - faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than bitcoin - while you save your bitcoin for the long-term.

this is why i believe in litecoin’s future.  we have seen adoption of bitcoin to the extent of etfs, corporate reserves, and government reserves.  the next step for these whales would be to begin using crypto for big deals and transactions.  what better coin to do that with than litecoin?  as it was designed for such and has the track record to be relied upon.

the counter-argument to that seems to be that there are newer coins that do this better.  i do not believe this to be the case.  for example, many tout solana would be better for this purpose, as its transaction time is nearly instant, compared to litecoin’s ~2.5 minutes.

it is true solana is faster, but its network has gone down on several occasions.  litecoin has never gone down in its history.  imagine a government or major corporation finally closing a deal, only for the crypto it planned to use to be completely inoperable at that moment.  

there is also the proof of stake versus proof of work discussion between the two, as well as solana not being a fair launch as reasons to prefer litecoin.

and then there’s ethereum, which i don’t believe compares to litecoin.  they’re not in competition.  both can succeed and/or both can fail.  ethereum is a bet on web3, while litecoin is a bet on peer-to-peer payments becoming more common.

besides thinking other coins may do what litecoin does but better, the only other criticism i see is litecoin’s founder selling his entire position.  however, this was 8 years ago.  he said he did this to make decisions about litecoin’s future without taking how those decisions would impact price into consideration.  a convenient thing to say when it was at an ath.  but this was 8 years ago, and the founder is still leading and adding new features like anonymity, so i don’t believe it matters that he sold his position anymore.  he has continued to act in the coin’s best interest, add features, and remain active to date.

another common criticism is that it’s just traded sideways for so long.  but i thought past performance is not predictive of future results?  there is still reason for, and the possibility of, big money adoption that i laid out above.  an etf seems to be on the horizon.  the tech simply works without issue.  the fact that it has traded sideways is an opportunity, not a criticism.

so i ask, why don’t you invest in litecoin?  what would you recommend i read to understand why i’m wrong?  i’m truly open to learning and do not claim to be an expert in this stuff.  but after all the research i’ve tried to do on my own so far, i haven’t really been able to convince myself it’s not a good investment.",0.9761,2502.26557948149

usa and germany still dominate in terms of node density, not a surprise here because they have a strong infrastructure and active communities. then we can see asia rising, singapore, japan and india are growing fast. tech savvy populations, regulatory shifts and builder ecosystems are making waves. another interesting places are emerging regiones like brazil, nigeria, kenya and south africa that are lighting up. not just consuming but building and validating the future of finance.

this is not about geography anymore, it is about resilience. with nodes spread across continents ethereum strength keeps growing and keeps being focused in its decentralization. more distributed networks, the harder it is to censor, control or shut down.

ethereum is not longer just a protocol, it is a planetary movement. unstoppable, permissionless, borderless.

2025-07-06 06:11:58,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lsu9a1/the_four_eras_of_the_blockchain/,"the four eras of the blockchain **first era: monolithic chains** (""which single chain will dominate?"")  
  
early on, the narrative, first with just bitcoin, and then bitcoin and ethereum, was winner-takes-all because each chain was self-contained: consensus, execution, and data availability were all bundled.  
  
**second era: multi-chain dreams**  
  
this gave rise to alt-l1s (solana, avalanche, etc.) and interoperability stacks (ibc, polkadot parachains). the thesis was fragmentation with cross-chain bridges.  
  
**third era: the rollup-centric vision (early modularism)**  
  
this marked the first real step away from monolithic design. the ""rollup-centric"" thesis envisioned rollups handling execution while relying on ethereum for consensus, settlement, and data availability.  
  
it could be summed up as: scale ethereum by offloading execution to external protocols, with ethereum acting as the unified provider for all core security services.  
  
**fourth era (today): full modularity & universal consensus**  
  
a radical decoupling is now underway. ethereum’s core components — consensus, data availability, and execution — are becoming independently swappable.   
  
through restaking (eigenlayer), ethereum’s consensus can be ""exported"" to secure other layers. this transforms ethereum from a settlement layer for its own rollups into a foundational consensus substrate for the entire modular ecosystem.  
  
**the new infrastructure**  
  
the shift is from a simple modular stack to a ""hyper-modular"" one, where components are not just separated but fully decoupled and recomposable.  
  
• consensus becomes ethereum's exportable commodity, making it the global timestamping and trust engine. through restaking protocols like eigenlayer, its unparalleled validator set can extend security guarantees to external protocols, like bridges, oracles, and even entire data availability layers. these protocols inherit ethereum's security without being native to it.  
  
• execution proliferates outward to modular extensions like optimistic and zk (validity) rollups, and autonomous verified services (avss),.  
  
• dedicated data availability systems allow rollups to post their data more cheaply, decoupling this function from the ethereum l1. crucially, these da layers can themselves rely on ethereum’s consensus via restaking (e.g. eigenda), creating a recursive security model.  
  
the new architectural paradigm is defined as:  
  
• one universal consensus root.  
  
• many interoperable modules for execution, settlement, and data availability.  
  
this is analogous to tcp/ip providing the base internet protocol, while other protocols can rent tcp/ip's reliability to secure their own networks.  
  
**economics**  
  
with everything deriving security, directly or indirectly, from ethereum, eth accrues value as a form of ""meta-security"".  
  
the value accrual vectors are:  
  
• **gas burns**: the base deflationary pressure remains.  
  
• **modular extensions paying for settlement**: constant demand for eth to finalize state on l1.  
  
• **restaking**: eigenlayer creates a marketplace where other protocols can ""rent"" ethereum’s security, paying fees to eth stakers. this opens new revenue streams for eth, reinforcing its role as a productive, capital asset.  
  
in terms of network effects for the ethereum blockchain: as assets ultimately settle on ethereum, it remains the center of gravity for defi, nfts, and institutional capital, preventing the liquidity fragmentation that a multi-chain technical landscape would create.  
  
the modularity of this architectural paradigm also means that ethereum validators are evolving into providers for a universal, decentralized trust service consumable by any protocol willing to pay for it.  
  
**implications**  
  
with ethereum as the trust root for all agentic (to include ais) coordination, we will see the emergence of a composable internet and open capital formation.  
  
• **the collapse of walled gardens**: the old internet rewards moats. web2 giants lock in users, data, and developers behind proprietary silos where integration means absorption. in contrast, ethereum provides a neutral ground. any two systems that publish commitments to ethereum can interoperate without new trust assumptions — no third-party custodians, only cryptographic enforcement. ecosystems no longer need to merge to integrate; they can specialize and collaborate by settling to the same source of truth. composability becomes the default, and network effects accrue to the shared coordination layer, not a private platform.  
• **an unbounded, permissionless scaling model**: ethereum is the first system where growth isn't bottlenecked by a centralized team or a locked-in feature set. its permissionless nature is twofold: anyone can participate (transact, validate) and anyone can build (introduce new functionality without a hard fork). this creates a scaling mechanism with a fully open supply curve, inherently resistant to the platform capture that defines web2. while monolithic chains hit a ""single-vendor"" wall, ethereum’s modular design allows anyone who restakes eth to spin up new capacity, inheriting full security. this creates an economic flywheel: more providers join → capacity rises → unit cost falls → better ux → more users → more fees → more providers.  
  
this is not a theoretical future; tangible metrics demonstrate its emergence:  
  
• **restaked eth**: \~$11 billion in total value locked (tvl) via eigenlayer, representing \~4.6 million eth.  
• **autonomous verifiable services (avss)**: 40 live avss with over 160 more in development, all secured by ethereum.  
• **rollup ecosystem**: 129 distinct live rollups with a combined tvl of over $42 billion, all inheriting l1 security.  
  
projects like megaeth already prove what this means in practice: web2-level throughput (130m+ transactions/day) with sub-cent fees, all while a full node can run on hobbyist hardware. the ceiling isn’t merely matching web2’s performance; it’s about building a more dynamic, open, and ultimately larger-scale system. ethereum's architecture was always designed to point beyond the limitations of centralized systems; we are now seeing the first implementations prove it.

ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. it is programmable money, the infrastructure for defi, nfts, daos, layer 2s, real world assets (rwas), stablecoins and a much more.

furthermore, all the decisions made by ethereum ecosystem have been made to make ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. since the shift to proof of stake, eth is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. it is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. holding eth is like holding a piece of a decentralized internet.

in the other hand we have bitcoin, yes, it is the og and respect to that. it has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it digital gold. however it is ""static"". you can't build apps on it like ethereum. no smart contracts, no ecosystem of dapps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.

while bitcoin is digital gold, ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.

thousands of devs are building the future of ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is ethereum. anyway, both are totally different things with totally different purposes so its a good way to ""diversify"".

we as shrimps dont have to pick sides, we just need to take advantage of opportunities to improve our lives and both are a must in a healthy portfolio.

### survey note: detailed analysis of hp suro.ai token

this survey note provides a comprehensive examination of the hp suro.ai token, based on the provided screenshot from the zapper app and additional research conducted as of 12:19 am cest on tuesday, july 08, 2025. the analysis aims to cover all relevant details, ensuring a thorough understanding of the token’s characteristics, market position, and associated risks.

#### introduction and context
the user provided a screenshot from the zapper app, specifically from the url ""zapper.xyz/nl/token/"", displaying details about the hp suro.ai token. zapper is known as a defi and nft tracker, offering real-time data on cryptocurrency tokens, and the screenshot reveals key metrics such as price, liquidity, and holder count. given the context, this analysis seeks to interpret the screenshot data, verify it against external sources, and assess the token’s viability and risks.

#### detailed token metrics
the screenshot, analyzed through the image, shows the following key metrics for the hp suro.ai token:
- **price**: €0.054, indicating the current market value per token in euros.
- **liquidity**: €4.44, a critical measure of how easily the token can be bought or sold without affecting its price, which is notably low.
- **fully diluted valuation (fdv)**: €667m, representing the total value if all tokens were in circulation, though this figure raised questions due to potential discrepancies with other data.
- **holders**: 6, suggesting very limited adoption and distribution.
- **total supply**: listed as ""123t hf,"" which appears to be a typo or a non-standard metric, possibly intended to mean 123 trillion tokens in a specific unit, but this requires further clarification.

the interface was dark-themed with purple accents, in dutch, with options to buy (""kopen"") or sell (""verkopen"") the token, and included the ethereum address ""0xbb90...1db1aa"" for verification.

#### verification with external sources
to validate the screenshot data, research was conducted using various online resources. the etherscan page for the token (https://etherscan.io/token/0xbb90626ddcaaca39d88e96ca017b9904821db1aa) listed:
- price: $0.00, which seems inaccurate compared to the screenshot, possibly indicating outdated or incorrect data.
- total supply: 123,456,789,012,345, a figure significantly larger than expected, suggesting potential issues with decimal places or circulating supply.
- number of holders: 5, slightly differing from the screenshot’s 6, which may reflect a recent change.

ethplorer (https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbb90626ddcaaca39d88e96ca017b9904821db1aa) confirmed the total supply as 1.2345678901234e+14 (123,456,789,012,340), aligning with etherscan, and noted 4 holders, adding to the variability in holder counts.

attempts to access the official suro.ai website (https://www.suro.ai/) yielded no readable text, suggesting it may be a landing page or under construction. further web searches for ""suro.ai cryptocurrency"" returned results primarily about suroma, a different ai-driven crypto platform, and suro capital corp., a venture capital fund, neither directly related to the token in question.

#### analysis of discrepancies
a significant discrepancy was noted in the fully diluted valuation (fdv). the screenshot reported fdv as €667m, but calculations based on the total supply (123,456,789,012,345) and price (€0.054) suggest an fdv of approximately €6.67 trillion, far exceeding the reported figure. this suggests:
- possible error in the total supply figure on etherscan/ethplorer, potentially misrepresenting decimal places.
- the fdv on zapper might be based on circulating supply rather than total supply, though this wasn’t specified.
- the ""123t hf"" in the screenshot might be a typo, possibly meant to be a different unit or value, contributing to the confusion.

given the low liquidity (€4.44), it’s plausible that the token is highly illiquid, affecting price stability and making the fdv calculation less reliable. the question mark next to fdv in the screenshot further indicates uncertainty in this metric.

#### market position and adoption
the token’s market position appears weak, with only 6 holders and liquidity of €4.44, indicating limited trading activity and adoption. this is corroborated by the inability to find recent discussions on x (formerly twitter) about the token, with searches yielding no results, suggesting low public interest or activity. the ethereum blockchain context aligns with the screenshot, but the lack of comprehensive data on exchanges or market caps (e.g., coingecko, coinmarketcap) reinforces its niche status.

#### risk assessment
the low liquidity and few holders are significant red flags for potential investors. liquidity of €4.44 implies that large transactions could significantly impact the price, making it risky for trading. with only 6 holders, the token lacks widespread adoption, increasing the risk of volatility and potential pump-and-dump schemes. the limited public information, with no clear project details from the official website and discrepancies in reported metrics, adds to the uncertainty, suggesting high risk for investment.

#### comparative context
for comparison, other ai-related tokens like sahara ai (sahara) were found in searches, with higher trading volumes and market caps, highlighting the disparity. however, these are distinct projects, and hp suro.ai’s specifics remain unclear, further emphasizing the need for caution.

#### conclusion and recommendations
research suggests that the hp suro.ai token, as depicted in the screenshot, is a high-risk cryptocurrency with a current price of €0.054, low liquidity of €4.44, and an fdv of €667m, though discrepancies in total supply and holder counts raise questions. it has 6 holders and operates on ethereum, but the lack of public information and low adoption indicate significant risks. potential investors should approach with caution, conducting thorough due diligence, and be aware of the potential for high volatility and illiquidity.

2025-07-10 08:45:14,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lw7pps/what_the_typical_crypto_investor_doesnt/,"what the typical crypto investor doesn’t understand is that eth is the gravitational center of the ethereum system no matter what scaling solution you look at: rollups, validiums, or eigenlayer-enabled systems like megaeth, everything still ultimately anchors back to onchain ether.

* rollups settle their state roots on ethereum l1, secured by validators who stake eth and paid for with ether-denominated fees.
* validiums keep data offchain but rely on ethereum to verify proofs, secured again by eth-staked validators.
* eigenlayer extends ethereum’s security to new services by restaking eth itself, making ether the direct collateral securing new decentralized systems.

no matter how modular the architecture becomes, eth will remain where value accrues, and what ties everything together.

yet despite ether’s central role in scalability, the proliferation of ethereum scalability solutions has not resulted in a flood of demand for eth.

the reason is simple: ethereum’s scalability solutions are still immature. the onchain statistics demonstrate this:

* ethereum mainnet holds about $121 billion in total value locked.
* the largest layer 2 solution, base, holds only about $2 billion — less than 2% of mainnet’s tvl.

the market overwhelmingly still trusts mainnet. rollups, restaking, and other modular systems are early in their lifecycle, still earning credibility in security, uptime, and adoption.

as these layers mature and the market gains confidence, more value will migrate outward, but it will remain anchored in ether.

if ethereum’s modular scaling roadmap is successfully executed, then orders of magnitude more economic activity will occur on modular extensions of ethereum than on mainnet, and in such a scenario, the demand that these extensions will generate for eth will become appreciable.

this list is subject to change and there may be more eips added or removed as we get closer to the release date!

in my opinion, below are upgrades that are important to me that i am excited to look forward to!!!

**verkle trees**… pectra upgrade pretty set up fusaka for releasing verkle trees which are wayyyyyy more efficient of a data structure than the current merkle patricia trees. verkle trees will allow the ethereum nodes so they can continue to validate blocks without storing an enormous amount of state data.

# tangent time!

like who the hell do they come up with these names? i didn’t know so i had to look it up haha.

patricia is the practical algorithm to retrieve information coded in alphanumeric.

merkle tree is used in cryptography due to the ability of creating a verifiable correlation of all data pieces of a tree which will result in one, single root value to prove the data!

therefore… merkle patricia tree is both cryptographically verifiable and deterministic! per the ethereum foundation

the only way to generate a state root is by computing it from each individual piece of the state, and two states that are identical can be easily proven so by comparing the root hash and the hashes that led to it (*a merkle proof*)

verkle trees was named by blending the sound and/or meaning of 2 words: ""merkle trees"" and ""vector commitment"".

now that we know the naming convention of the current and future trees, lets continue!

verkle trees will be more efficient, enable stateless clients, while making ethereum lighter, faster, and even more decentralized!

# i’m also looking forward to peerdas (peer data availability sampling)!

we saw the blob improvements in the pectra upgrade and we should expect more in the fusaka upgrade. blob sampling will be further improved for rollups, data availability will be enhanced without affecting the node burden, layer 2s will be further scaled up, and will future-proof ethereum’s data availability layer. hell yeah!

# a third upgrade i am excited for is the evm object format (eof).

eof will streamline the process for how smart contracts are created and executed! essentially, predictability, gas efficiency, and security will be improved for developers which will affect all users on the blockchain!

think of fusaka as ethereum’s “deep clean and upgrade” phase, polishing the internals of the protocol for long-term future-proof growth. lets gooooooooooooo!",0.9969,2807.8623806719115

2025-07-11 01:12:26,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lwttto/altcoin_rally_and_altseason_signals/,"altcoin rally and altseason signals [chart showing btc\/usdt](https://preview.redd.it/dt68cslma5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd87a01908addf934ee0739d749c95a788ab8ea5)

as bitcoin breaks its all-time high again and ethereum begins to show meaningful rebound trends, the market's focus naturally shifts to the anticipation of whether the altcoin market will now catch fire. however, one must remember that the market's structure operates in contexts beyond mere price rises. the phenomenon known as altseason is not defined by a few specific coins rising; the key lies in how funds flow and how market participants interpret that flow. the current phase seems closer to a period of checking the potential for a shift in capital rotation rather than a short-term rally.

  

# understanding bitcoin dominance as an altcoin rally signal

 

[chart showing bitcoin dominace](https://preview.redd.it/aazyf58qa5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb779ebd45319266c2e76f8bc3231b05e3e06b7)

 

the first criterion for judging market structure is bitcoin dominance. this indicator distinguishes whether liquidity entering the market is staying solely in bitcoin or gradually moving to ethereum and altcoins. a true altseason occurs when funds progressively flow from bitcoin to ethereum and then to mid- and small-cap altcoins.

if bitcoin's dominance forms a peak and turns downward, it can be interpreted as a signal that funds seeking higher returns are starting to move to other sectors. recently, despite bitcoin's new highs, dominance has been stagnating or slightly declining, which appears to be a turning point worth watching closely. if this trend persists, it's hard to ignore the possibility that the market's balance is tilting toward altcoins.

 

# the role of eth/btc ratio in altseason signals

 

[chart showing eth\/btc](https://preview.redd.it/y854kmzva5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=338d35e096bce3d26ee605999cef06bf53db2ade)

 

in the same vein, the eth/btc ratio plays a crucial role. the real starting point of altseason has always coincided with the rise of this ratio. when ethereum begins to show strength against bitcoin, the market accepts it as a signal of structural recovery. this is not just because of its position as the second-largest by market cap, but because ethereum serves as a central hub connecting defi, l2, nft, and infrastructure ecosystems. ethereum's strength implies more than just price; it suggests the recovery of demand across the entire alt market.

if the eth/btc ratio consolidates at the bottom and continues its rebound, it could be seen as a clear 'first confirmation signal,' providing investors with reason to reassess their altcoin portfolios.

 

# broader market factors influencing altcoin rallies

that said, it's still too early to draw firm conclusions. while funds concentrating in some thematic altcoins are detectable, it's hard to view this as spreading to the entire market. for instance, the recent rises in tokens related to ai, rwa, and depin are closer to localized rallies driven by specific narratives rather than a broad alt market uptrend. for an environment worthy of being called altseason to form, widespread concurrent rises must appear across ethereum-based projects, neglected mid- and small-cap chains, various l1 and l2 ecosystems, and thematic defi and nft projects. particularly, without accompanying recovery in trading volume and on-chain metrics, the market is unlikely to sustain on short-term expectations alone—a critical perspective is needed here. these indicators serve as keys to gauging market health, steering away from fixation on mere price fluctuations.

moreover, altseason has always emerged in market cycles after bitcoin's stable rally. in phases where bitcoin repeats sharp ups and downs, funds seek stability, which acts as poison to the alt market. conversely, when btc stabilizes at a certain high or enters a sideways phase, market participants then turn to risk assets for greater returns, and that's when the altcoin market starts to stir. **the current situation being merely the 'initial stage of fund movement' suggests that excessive optimism should be guarded against.**

 

# external economic triggers like us rate cuts

 

[fed rate cut probabilities from cme fedwatch tool: essential signals for anticipating altcoin rally in h2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/vzyaq610b5cf1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddfe4135c1da0757d53483a0dd29cf7f5e82521)

 

if expectations of u.s. interest rate cuts, signs of liquidity re-expansion, and tech stock-led stock market rises align, a full-fledged risk-on flow could form in the cryptocurrency market as well. in such a case, funds are likely to flow sequentially beyond bitcoin to eth and the entire altcoin market. **especially, with institutional funds accessing the market through various channels like stablecoins and blackrock etfs, the current flow creates an environment where altseason can be designed on a foundation entirely different from the past**. while these external factors can promote structural changes in the market, considering that their effects may not be immediate calls for flexibility in investment strategies.

bitcoin's current movements are not significant on the surface. amid fluctuations of around 2%, it even shows patterns of digesting selling volume in a box range retest phase. observing whether small buys are gradually entering in this range or if selling resumes at resistance levels is more important. real bull markets often create vertical rises without giving time to buy. if the market is giving time for many to ponder support and resistance and worry about corrections, it also means it's still early. in other words, it's not too late. rather, if meaningful corrections emerge in this process, that point could become a buying opportunity. strategies focusing on accumulating spot positions in major coins like bitcoin, ethereum, solana, and ripple remain valid. full-fledged rallies usually start not after people's convictions form, but while doubts linger.

while bitcoin shows volatility of 1-3% per day, opportunities are more frequently observed on the altcoin side. especially since the overall market hasn't entered an overheated phase on a spot basis, strategies to accumulate positions in such phases may be reasonable. more important than short-term fluctuations is where funds are residing and in which direction they are moving. this could be the starting point of that transition.

 

[chart of the altcoin season index](https://preview.redd.it/76b8u665b5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=75411e89903e8db99b9a9453cd790560bf48084b)

 

of course, the futures market now offers environments for significant profits. but looking back at past flows, in phases where bull markets fully materialize, investors maintaining consistent spot portfolios often recorded higher returns. short-term trading is a means to maximize momentary profits, but when the market starts riding a structural uptrend, long-term holding strategies can work more advantageously. this is even more so in phases where market vitality is reviving like now.

particularly, fixating on daily charts, immersing in daily market updates on cafes or communities, or relying on overly amplified macroeconomic analyses to time buys often leads to getting caught in fomo psychology. but the market doesn't wait for such interpretations or predictions. directions don't change immediately just because rates rise slightly or inflation stabilizes somewhat, and in fact, bitcoin has broken new highs amid such debates. this approach may seem analytical on the surface, but in reality, it tends to lead to fixation on instant profits, pushing oneself into increasingly unstable states. above all, even when the market starts to grasp a full direction at crucial points, most are not prepared to ride that flow.

a single trading mistake can damage an account, or conversely, missing one opportunity can leave one watching the entire bull market from the sidelines. given that the current market environment favors structural and long-term strategies more, taking such risks seems unwarranted. reflecting back, investors who consistently held spot or some futures from april onward would now be in sufficient profit zones. the likelihood is high that this yielded far better results than repeated frantic trading daily. ultimately, attempts to time the market often lead to frequent failures, **whereas those riding structural uptrends gain the effects of compounding through time and direction. approaches that are not sustainable or recoverable can become causes for pushing oneself out of the market even in bull phases.**

for some, this phase may be a time to prepare for new opportunities, while for others, it could be interpreted as a section to trim positions or reduce risks. but what's important is clearly establishing one's strategy and building a portfolio accordingly. while it's not yet possible to assert what flow's starting point this is, it seems sufficient timing as preparation to close out the fourth quarter of this year with meaningful profits. approach it with a strategic perspective, without being too hasty but without missing the flow.",0.9962,2932.6521093985307

2025-07-13 09:17:23,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lyoijz/the_role_of_memecoins_in_todays_cryptocurrency/,"the role of memecoins in today’s cryptocurrency ecosystem memecoins—cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes and viral culture—have evolved from niche novelties to significant players in the cryptocurrency landscape. tokens like dogecoin (doge), shiba inu (shib), bonk (bonk), and platforms like *pump<>fun* exemplify their multifaceted impact. as of july 2025, memecoins continue to drive innovation, adoption, and market dynamics across various dimensions, despite their speculative nature. as you may know based on some of my comments and posts, i believe memecoins are a key driving force and they will continue to propel blockchain/cryptocurrency innovations to audience that desire a soft landing platform to crypto. i have put together this post to portray key examples and recent developments.

## driving user adoption and onboarding
memecoins serve as an accessible entry point for new crypto users. their low price points and viral appeal attract retail investors who might otherwise shy away from complex defi or nft projects. dogecoin, launched in 2013, gained mainstream traction through endorsements from figures like elon musk, peaking at a $90 billion market cap in 2021. its simplicity—built on a bitcoin fork—made it a gateway for millions to explore crypto wallets and exchanges. similarly, shiba inu, an ethereum-based token, onboarded users via its “doge killer” branding, reaching a $40 billion market cap in 2021. by 2025, bonk on solana has drawn thousands to its ecosystem, with its playful dog-themed narrative boosting solana wallet creation by ~15% during its 2023 peak, ~ **source** solana foundation data.

recent events, like pump-fun’s $500 million pump token sale recently, highlight memecoins’ onboarding power. pump-fun gamified launchpad, which enabled over 5 million meme token creations on solana *[according to on-chain stats], attracted both creators and speculators, driving platform revenue to $715 million by mid-2025. this accessibility fosters broader crypto adoption, particularly among younger demographics.

## boosting blockchain activity and liquidity
memecoins significantly increase transaction volumes and liquidity on their host blockchains. dogecoin’s 2021 surge drove transaction spikes on its network, with daily volumes reaching 1.5 million transactions - [*bitinfocharts*] . shiba inu’s trading on ethereum contributed ~10-15% to the chain’s transaction volume during its 2021 peak, according to dune analytics. bonk’s 2023 rise on solana similarly boosted network activity [a period when many including holders like me were very skeptical about solana future after many network halts and restarts], with daily transactions hitting 5million+ during its hype cycle. these surges elevate gas fees and validator revenue, strengthening blockchain economics.

pumpdotfun success underscores this trend. its solana-based platform, with more than $20 million in monthly revenue as of july 2025, has increased sol demand and liquidity. the pump token sale, selling 125 billion tokens in 12 minutes across major exchanges like bybit and kraken, amplified solana’s market visibility, contributing to a ~20% market cap increase in q2 2025, per coingecko.

## fostering innovation and ecosystem growth
- memecoins spur innovation by encouraging developers to build supporting infrastructure. shiba inu’s ecosystem expanded to include shibaswap, a dex, and nft integrations, enhancing ethereum’s defi landscape. bonk’s success on solana led to tools like pumpswap, a dex launched by pump-fun in 2025, which shares 50% of trading revenue with token creators. this creator-friendly model has driven developer interest, with solana’s dapp ecosystem growing more than 17% since pump-d-fun’s january 2024 launch, - dappradar.

- memecoins also inspire novel mechanics. pumps bonding curve model, where token prices rise as buys increase, and its liquidity-locking feature have set new standards for token launches, reducing rug pull risks. these innovations strengthen blockchain ecosystems, attracting more projects and users. a feature that many standalone blockchains lack even with today's crypto market awareness. 

## cultural and social impact
memecoins leverage internet culture to create and engaged communities, fostering loyalty and advocacy. dogecoin’s “tipping” culture on platforms like reddit built a grassroots following, while shib’s “shibarmy” drove social media hype, with over 1 million x[twitter] followers by 2025. bonk’s community-centric airdrops in 2023 revitalized solana’s ecosystem post-ftx collapse, boosting morale and adoption.

## challenges and risks
despite their benefits, memecoins pose risks too and it will be very silly to not acknowledge these risks. their speculative nature fuels volatility—pump*d*fun’s trading volume dropped 75-80% since january 2025 - *[defillama]*, reflecting market fickleness. scams, like bsc’s squid game token rug pull in 2021, highlight vulnerabilities. overreliance on memecoin hype can also skew blockchain development toward short-term gains, potentially deterring serious projects. regulatory scrutiny remains a concern, as memecoins’ speculative appeal could invite crackdowns, impacting broader markets.

## my take on memecoins
memecoins like dogecoin, shiba inu, bonk, and platforms like pump-fun, etc are more than fleeting trends—they drive adoption, liquidity, innovation, and cultural engagement in the crypto ecosystem. while their volatility and risks warrant caution, their ability to onboard users, boost blockchain activity, and inspire new tools is undeniable. as of july 2025, memecoins remain a dynamic force, shaping cryptocurrency’s growth and mainstream appeal, with pump-fun’s $500 million token sale vocalising their enduring impact. however, sustainable growth requires balancing their speculative allure with robust ecosystem development.",0.9989,2953.9141264221453
2025-07-13 11:49:39,,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lyqvz6/how_restaked_eth_is_being_used_to_build_a_supreme/,"how restaked eth is being used to build a 'supreme court' for crypto, judging everything from ai to oracles for years, blockchains have excelled at enforcing objective truth: cryptographic, provable, indisputable. but as we push into richer domains like verifiable ai, decentralized social media, and advanced oracle networks, we’re hitting a wall. these new frontiers bring subjective questions that can’t be resolved by code alone.

this is where a new architectural pattern emerges: layered trust. at its core, it combines the hard guarantees of ethereum with the flexibility of human judgment.

a leading example is the verifiable cloud (eigencloud on @eigenlayer). its security model has two distinct layers:

• restaked eth enforces objective rules — was the data posted? did the computation execute? — with automatic slashing for failure. no interpretation needed.
• eigen handles subjective disputes: was an oracle’s source reliable? did an ai’s output meet agreed standards? — via decentralized arbitration.

the brilliance lies in the separation of concerns. ethereum’s validator set, amplified through restaking, forms an unshakable foundation. on top of this foundation, eigen provides a social layer for gray areas where algorithmic certainty ends and human discernment begins.

the ""slash-and-fork"" mechanism is key here. when disputes arise, stakers vote. malicious actors are slashed; honest participants fork to the correct state. crucially, this mechanism works because it inherits the economic weight of ethereum. without eth’s security budget underpinning it, the system wouldn’t hold.

this is the crux: the subjective layer only has value because it’s anchored to ethereum’s objective guarantees. this layered approach could unlock decentralized governance, ai moderation, and trust-minimized data services — all backed by the most battle-tested security in crypto.

it also reframes staking itself. no longer just a passive yield generator, restaked eth becomes an active force, providing programmable trust to power the emerging verifiable internet.

if it works, we could see an entire class of oracles, ai agents, data-availability layers, and even rollups renting ethereum’s security instead of bootstrapping their own. this composability makes eth not just a currency or a commodity but the base layer for digital truth.

solana, bnb chain, and tron led the activity. solana especially stood out. it alone handled almost 60 percent of all transactions. that spike didn’t just happen out of nowhere. a lot of it came from meme coins launching non-stop on solana platforms like letsbonk and pumpfun. these tokens are highly speculative but they’re pulling in a ton of new users. the chain has been nonstop busy.  
  
bnb chain had a smaller slice of the volume, around 19 percent, but it still has the most applications built on it. it covers everything from defi to gaming to nfts and that mix helps keep users active and money flowing. it also got a recent speed boost after the maxwell upgrade, which reduced block time to around 0.75 seconds. it’s smoother now and feels more responsive.  
  
solana, bnb chain, and tron are also still among the most used chains daily. tron even passed ethereum in daily usdt volume. it’s mostly large whale trades plus over a million smaller retail transactions happening every day. that kind of consistent flow shows that these chains actually have real communities using them.  
  
sure, some of this spike is probably driven by speculation and hype but even with that, 342 million transactions in one week is a serious number. it shows more people are actively using blockchains rather than just watching from the sidelines.

just asked a llm to analyse the above.


navigating the clarity act: which blockchains are most likely to be ""digital commodities""

the proposed digital asset market clarity act of 2025 (clarity act) is gaining traction in the us house of representatives this ""crypto week"" (mid-july 2025). this bill aims to bring much-needed regulatory certainty by establishing a clear framework for digital assets — primarily by defining ""digital commodities"" and assigning their oversight to the cftc.

a core component is the ""maturity test"", which assesses if a blockchain system and its native asset are truly decentralized and utility-driven. it generally looks for:

decentralization: the system is ""not controlled by any person or group of persons under common control.""

utility-driven: the token's value is ""substantially derived from the use and functioning of the blockchain system.""

broadly distributed: ownership by ""certain holders"" must be under 20% of outstanding supply.


i've put together a breakdown of how major blockchain projects stack up, ranked from most to least likely to qualify as a ""digital commodity"" under this framework.


---

🔹 bitcoin (btc) — very high likelihood

strengths:

unquestionably decentralized — no issuer, widely distributed mining and nodes

clear utility as a store of value and medium of exchange

fair launch and fixed supply (21m btc)

governance is slow, organic, and highly decentralized


challenges:

mining pool concentration

asic manufacturer centralization (minor)



---

🔹 ethereum (eth) — very high likelihood

strengths:

decentralized validator set post-merge (pos)

multiple, independent clients (geth, nethermind, besu, etc.)

essential for defi, nfts, staking — strong native utility

open governance via eips and dev calls


challenges:

lido dominance in staked eth may raise concerns

historical ico (but long since matured)



---

🔹 cardano (ada) — high likelihood

strengths:

many stake pools; designed for high decentralization

voltaire era introducing full on-chain governance

ada used for fees, staking, and smart contracts

good validator distribution


challenges:

past reliance on iohk (declining as governance matures)



---

🔹 algorand (algo) — high-moderate likelihood

strengths:

pure pos allows wide participation

growing community-driven governance

utility includes asas, fees, and staking

technically scalable and efficient


challenges:

past centralization of relay nodes

foundation’s large token allocation may trigger scrutiny



---

🔹 internet computer (icp) — moderate-high likelihood

strengths:

on-chain dao (nns) governs the protocol

icp used for computation, storage gas, node rewards

ambitious goal to decentralize the internet itself


challenges:

dfinity foundation’s role at genesis still lingers

specialized hardware for node providers may limit diversity

controversial initial unlock raises ""value from others"" concerns



---

🔹 hedera (hbar) — moderate likelihood

strengths:

governing council includes global enterprises (google, ibm, etc.)

hbar used for smart contracts, fees, and staking

gradual roadmap to permissionless nodes

built with regulatory compliance in mind


challenges:

council may be viewed as ""common control""

initial token distribution favors early insiders



---

🔹 sui (sui) — low-moderate likelihood

strengths:

unique object-centric design, strong dapp utility

dpos governance allows community involvement

used for fees, staking, and governance


challenges:

high hardware and capital requirements limit validator diversity

large allocation to mysten labs and the sui foundation

risk of perceived centralization and control



---

🔹 solana (sol) — low likelihood

strengths:

extremely fast, low fees, vibrant dapp ecosystem

sol used for fees, staking, governance


challenges:

validator costs are prohibitively high (centralization risk)

network outages + coordinated restarts = potential control concerns

dominance of a single client implementation

large initial allocations to insiders and vcs



---

🔍 final thoughts on the clarity act

final wording matters: the bill is still evolving in congress and may be amended (especially with cbdc bans in play).

regulator discretion: the sec and cftc will apply the ""maturity test"" case by case.

ongoing progress matters: projects increasing decentralization, validator access, and community control can improve their chances over time.",0.9984,3428.419380803104

tron has always been associated with shady practices and the general shadiness of justin sun. 
 
however it now seems justin sun is in with the trump admin due to large purchases of the $trump token. the sec has dropped its investigation of sun. tron, the company, is going public via a reverse merger with srm entertainment using eric trump’s company.

i'm looking for some advice on the best network to **hodl usdc**. i want to build a long-term reserve of usdc, and i already have a **hardware wallet**, which gives me great security for my private keys. however, i'm really torn about which network to use for storing my usdc.

after some research, i understand that keeping usdc on the **ethereum network** would likely be the most secure option, given its unparalleled robustness and decentralization. the downside, though, is the significantly higher cost for sending and moving funds on ethereum. this makes it quite unattractive for smaller amounts, especially during peak times like a **bull market**, when gas fees can skyrocket.

a promising alternative i've been considering is storing my usdc on **polygon**. as an ethereum layer 2 solution, polygon offers much lower transaction fees and faster confirmations.

my main question is: does the added security of ethereum justify the high costs for a long-term reserve, or would the practicality and cost-effectiveness of polygon be an acceptable compromise, especially since i'm already using the protection of a hardware wallet?

i'd really appreciate your insights on this balance between cost and security for hodling usdc. what's your recommendation? thanks in advance!",0.9827,3615.845134749492

i am pure degenerate.

i believe this coin has the legs to run, the community to support it, and the founder to bootstrap it.

i believe richard heart moved the 80k btc.

i believe when he said he mined 300k btc in 2011 back when he live-streamed in 2019 era.

i believe we will see the most epic pump after eth tops.

i think the hex community has received the most hate and ridicule, but throughout everything, they are still here and believe harder than ever that richard heart made the best crypto products (and is still making them…. liberty finance . swap)

i’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what richard heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.

1) bitcoin.  people wanted to earn yield, so they gave their bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their btc.  guess who warned you of gemini, celcius, ftx, etc?  richard.

he actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in december 2019.  which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.

so this guy richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  

the money used to buy asics, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  a hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.

so hex is born.

2) ethereum.  best product that crypto has offered.  period.  bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  it can’t do sheet.  ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  

but them gas fees yo.  every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.

hence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  it’s not some l2 that is centralized on one dudes node.

it’s world wide. no one can turn it off.  and it’s faster and cheaper than ethereum.  so now ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  best of all worlds.  

pulsechain is born.

3) uniswap.  did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  there’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  all uni token holders are getting kucked.

so richard made plsx.  buy and burn features turned on, and cannot be turned off.  it’s the drunken michael saylor buying the plsx token forevermore with every swap that occurs on pulsechain. 

with $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, and everybody hates the chain.  imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…


so these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  but richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.


rh believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.

what other meme coin can boast such stats?

i like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  freedom to transact.

oh ya, and pdai…. nvm, you’ll find out soon enough.

**in an era where apple's $110 billion buyback barely moves markets and private equity firms struggle with record-long holding periods, a decentralized exchange has quietly orchestrated the most revolutionary buyback program in financial history.**

while traditional markets celebrated another record-breaking year of corporate buybacks—with s&p 500 companies returning $942.5 billion to shareholders in 2024—a different kind of experiment was unfolding in the digital asset space. hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, has created what can only be described as the greatest buyback experiment in the history of private equity: a fully automated, revenue-driven capital recycling engine that makes traditional buyback programs look antiquated by comparison.

# the magnitude of the machine

hyperliquid's assistance fund has amassed more than $1 billion in hype tokens, creating a major capital recycling engine where 97% of the fees collected from users are used to buy back hype. to put this in perspective, the platform recently purchased $4.72 million worth of hype in a single day, with an average price of $47.43, while maintaining strong buyback mechanics of $2 million per day.

this isn't just impressive—it's unprecedented. when we examine the scale relative to the platform's size and age, hyperliquid's buyback intensity dwarfs anything seen in traditional private equity. the platform has accumulated over $77 million in usdc inflows to its assistance fund, with over $25 million in the past month alone, translating to an average daily buyback of approximately $1 million worth of hype.

# beyond the numbers: a new paradigm

what makes hyperliquid's approach revolutionary isn't just the scale—it's the mechanism itself. unlike traditional private equity buybacks that depend on discretionary board decisions, market timing, and complex approval processes, hyperliquid operates like a protocol-funded participant, always bidding, always buying.

using an average contract trading fee of 0.0225%, with profits distributed between hlp and af in a 46:54 split, approximately 54% ($18.79 million) enters the af fund to buy back hype, translating into an annualized net profit of $225.5 million. this creates what amounts to an auto-scarcity mechanism that not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity, creating additional upward pressure on token price.

# the private equity context

to understand why this matters, consider the current state of traditional private equity. the median holding period for a private equity-backed company reached an all-time high of seven years in 2023 but experienced a dramatic decline in 2024 to 5.9 years, while private equity firms hold more than 28,000 assets, 40% of which have been held for longer than four years.

traditional private equity struggles with what economists call the ""liquidity paradox""—the longer you hold assets, the more difficult it becomes to achieve efficient exits. firms are sitting on record amounts of dry powder while facing prolonged holding periods that frustrate limited partners and distort returns.

# the hyperliquid solution

hyperliquid has solved this paradox through what could be called ""perpetual liquidity generation."" rather than waiting for exit opportunities, the platform creates continuous value through its buyback mechanism. the automatic nature of the assistance fund's buyback activity, directly fueled by protocol revenue, creates a transparent and programmatic link between the platform's operational success and mechanisms designed to support the token's value.

this approach mirrors the best practices of traditional private equity—focusing on operational excellence and cash generation—while eliminating the industry's biggest weakness: exit dependency. every day of successful trading activity translates directly into buyback pressure, creating what doug colkitt, founder of ambient finance, calls alignment between ""a project's tokenomics and user incentives regardless of prevailing market conditions"".

# the performance proof

the results speak for themselves. hype has soared to an all-time high of $42 and is up 65% in the last month, beating bitcoin, ethereum and solana. more importantly, the assistance fund is sitting on a trove of $680 million in paper gains after buying hype tokens at an average price of $14.

hyperliquid's futures trading volume has continued its upward trajectory, recording $443 billion year-to-date in 2024, with november alone seeing a record-high trading volume of $77 billion, capturing an impressive 45% market share in the crypto futures dex market. this organic growth, combined with the buyback mechanism, creates a virtuous cycle that traditional private equity can only dream of achieving.

# why this changes everything

traditional private equity operates on a model of buy, improve, and exit. this creates inherent tension between value creation and value realization. hyperliquid has created a fourth option: buy, improve, and continuously compound through systematic buybacks.

the implications extend far beyond crypto. by purchasing and burning hype tokens from the market, supply contracts, and the proportional value of remaining tokens naturally increases. this auto-scarcity mechanism not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity.

this model addresses three critical challenges facing modern private equity:

**1. the exit bottleneck:** rather than depending on ipo markets or strategic buyers, value is continuously realized through buybacks.

**2. the lp patience problem:** instead of waiting years for distributions, token holders see continuous value accretion through supply reduction.

**3. the scale efficiency question:** the more successful the platform becomes, the more aggressive the buybacks become, creating exponential rather than linear value creation.

# the broader revolution

other crypto projects like jupiter and dydx have similar plans, with estimates suggesting various protocols will repurchase hundreds of millions worth of tokens annually. but hyperliquid stands apart in both scale and execution sophistication.

hyperliquid stands apart from the rest of the ecosystem, with no true direct comparison. the project's development has been entirely self-financed, fostering organic and sustainable growth. the revenues generated by the protocol are among the highest in the industry and are entirely reinvested into hype buybacks through the assistance fund.

# the future of capital allocation

what we're witnessing with hyperliquid isn't just a clever financial engineering trick—it's the emergence of a new paradigm for capital allocation that could reshape how we think about value creation and distribution in private markets.

the traditional private equity model, with its dependence on external exit markets and discrete liquidity events, suddenly looks as antiquated as dividend-paying utilities in a world of growth stocks. unlike dividend models, where scarcity is contingent on individual reinvestment decisions, hyperliquid's automatic burn system reinforces the network's tokenomics without relying on user behavior.

# the bottom line

while apple makes headlines with $110 billion buyback announcements and private equity firms struggle with extended holding periods, hyperliquid has quietly built the most sophisticated capital recycling machine in financial history. it's not just the largest buyback experiment in private equity—it's the blueprint for how capital allocation should work in the digital age.

the question isn't whether this model will be copied—it's how quickly traditional private equity will adapt to remain relevant in a world where automated, performance-linked buybacks have redefined what efficient capital allocation looks like.

in an industry built on the promise of superior returns through operational excellence, hyperliquid hasn't just delivered—it's created a new category entirely. this isn't just the greatest buyback experiment in private equity history; it's the beginning of private equity's next evolution.

we’re joining forces with r/ethtrader for a community-driven donation drive to support the legal defense of roman storm, co-founder of tornado cash. this isn’t just about one developer — it’s about defending privacy, open-source development, and the very principles that make ethereum and crypto possible.

# why this matters

roman is facing years in prison for publishing open-source privacy software — tools anyone could freely use. at the time, the only official guidance (from fincen) said developers of such software weren’t money transmitters. yet in august 2023, u.s. authorities arrested him, charging conspiracy, unlicensed money transmission, and sanctions violations.

the doj’s narrative misrepresents the facts:

* roman and his co-founder ""never operated a service"" — they only published code.
* they added filters in their web wallet code to block sanctioned addresses but couldn’t control forks of their software.
* the prosecution hinges on a ""novel legal theory"": that ""money transmission"" applies even without custody of funds.

this case sets a dangerous precedent: if developers can be punished for misuse of open-source code, innovation and privacy in crypto are at risk. the first amendment protects code as speech — yet prosecutors treat it like an afterthought, even resorting to absurd analogies (comparing money transmission to ""a frying pan conducting heat"").

# the situation now

roman’s trial began july 14, 2025, in manhattan. what was expected to last 2 weeks may now stretch 3-4, with skyrocketing costs for expert witnesses, research, and legal fees. the defense fund urgently needs ""another $1.5m"" to sustain the fight.

the ethereum foundation has stepped up with ""$500k"" and will ""match community donations up to $750k"" — doubling your impact.

i simply share my analysis of why i think that zcash (zec) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

it's also not meant as input for short-term trading, i'm not interested in that and i think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

# starting point

bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken saylor could spend.

the narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (sov) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space/) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

the launch of blackrock's bitcoin etf [ibit](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7b aum is considered the most successful etf launch *in history*.

the u.s. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**nothing stops this train.**

that means number go up for bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. with gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the s&p500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

ethereum and solana have both been underperforming bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) recently raising $500m in 12 minutes. or $600m, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

crypto twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much bitcoin is pumping. retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on x.

# a privacy renaissance?

meanwhile, the word on the street is that aml regulations are getting out of control. it's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

people have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

interacted with a mixer six years go? please explain yourself.

the eu is leading the way again in regulation with mica, the only area where the eu seems to be leading these days. this lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

# why should privacy coins outperform?

i think it's safe to say that bitcoin has been institutionalized. bitcoin maxis are cheering for michael saylor, etfs, and even strategic bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the bitcoins in the reserve. or the ones from whom the bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

there are various l2 solution trying to add privacy to bitcoin, i'll write in another post why i don't think these will add privacy to bitcoin in any meaningful way. i hope i'm wrong, though, and projects like [fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [cashu](https://cashu.me/) get mainstream adoption.

the problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

swapping bitcoin for monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

so was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

# will bitcoin dominate forever?

as i said in the beginning, bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and bitcoin got it.

the only thing that bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good l1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. we can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. it's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the l1 protocol layer, given the ossification of bitcoin.

currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): the leading privacy coin monero has only \~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, zcash, only \~1/3300th.

so why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

it's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually monero, over bitcoin. [archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archetyp_market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250m euro in revenue.

so why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? and while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. why should that change?

* the market cap of bitcoin is $2.3t
* the market cap of gold is $22t
* total global asset value is [\~$1,000t](https://x.com/croesus_btc/status/1919385198795338165)
* that is, the market cap of bitcoin is \~1/10th of gold and \~0.2% of total assets
* the market cap of all privacy coins ([coingecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4b
* the market cap of monero is $6b
* the market cap of zcash is $0.7b
* undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10t, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
* that is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than \~0.1% of offshore wealth**

due to increasing aml regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. that's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. this will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider defi ecosystem.

another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

all the kyc & aml regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the ledger email leak that happened years ago.

so hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

# zcash vs. monero

as has been argued in [another post](https://frankbraun.org/t-addr), zcash has better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of zec in circulation are currently in shielded pools. that's quickly increasing due to the ""zashi effect"" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [keystone](https://keyst.one/). ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

holding zec in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. higher tvl in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for zec. it's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

monero currently has the lead over zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare zcash shielded transaction to default monero transactions. at least until fcmp++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of fcmp++ over zero-knowledge proofs.

# the importance of ux

monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but i want to share an observation i made over the years.

open-source has been really effective in delivering superior ""base layer"" infrastructure components: the linux kernel, the gcc compiler, various programming languages, etc.

but it's usually very bad at delivering world-class ux, these usually come from companies, apple being the most famous example.

i think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great ux. nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great ux needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

given that zcash currently has the better base technology (monero is catching up with fcmp++), the war for the end user is won in the ux, and there [electric coin company](https://electriccoin.co/) under josh swihart is currently leading the way with [zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

the typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great ux and already has a ledger.

# privacy is necessary for commerce

most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

the term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

you can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is.

for example, there is good reason why a lot of hr departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. if you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like gdpr) exist for a reason. i'm not a lawyer, but i would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

just as the world wide web (using the http protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to https) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. see also: [zcash, the https of blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in january 2020).

and while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

for a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

# halvings

zcash is about two halving cycles behind bitcoin. while inflation in bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of \~12.5% to \~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in november 2024. this might serve as a catalyst for zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

the next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely \~2%.

and after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub \~1%.

bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. but from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

# tracking

of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. but picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

* btc: 118844.42 usd
* xmr: 334.72 usd
* zec: 44.23 usd

let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

# conclusion

if the network effects of bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both monero and zcash should underperform bitcoin.

if privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both monero and zcash should overperform bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising \~80% of it (according to [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

given that zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making ux advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both monero and bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

which is why i consider zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**it has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. higher tvl in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. it's a great flywheel.

the largest risks i see is that monero quickly catches on with fcmp++ and better ux, or that the recent quick ux advances in zcash slow down. for example, due to lack of funding for electric coin company, because recent [changes to the zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ecc doesn't automatically receive ""protocol funding"" anymore.

commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

i guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

until then — stay safe out there anon!""

i run an ai agent firm, and i don't think people are really ready for the collision of these two technologies. let me explain why. we're in a renaissance. looking at the last renaissance around the 1500s, there was an intersection between two technological revolutions: information networks and ledgers. books could disseminate new ideas, which disrupted the catholic church's monopoly on the bible, leading to the protestant reformation. subsequently, protestants fled europe and came to america. double-entry accounting gave birth to nation-states, stock markets, corporatism, and public stock exchanges. **it completely transformed our world and scaled our ability to cooperate.**

we have this same thing now, a financial reformation, where the people no longer need the permission from an elite heriarchy to access what is essentially just a book. an important one, that can only have entries appended to. it is a revolution in how clearing is done.

i define a renaissance as an intersection of innovations in our lists and information networks. today, we've had numerous innovations. sql and relational databases have transformed our world as a list powered at light speed. the internet, telegram, telephone, and social media have revolutionized information networks. now we have cryptocurrency, which is an innovation in the ledger, and llms (large language models), creating a new intersection of technological disruptions to our civilization's core pillars.

a notable author to explore on this topic is yuval noah harari. these technologies cannot fit in the old world or old way of thinking because they give birth to new economic ideologies. just as double-entry accounting gave us capitalism, cryptocurrency will give us something else.

i believe cryptocurrencies will ultimately converge into one because these systems are identical - they are decentralized verification systems where you put a message in, and everyone on the network can verify whether your message is there or not. all 15,000 cryptocurrencies perform the same function.

ai agents won't be using bank accounts; they'll be using cryptocurrency. they will make decisions and purchases, and i don't think people realize how disruptive this combination of technologies will be. they will likely settle on one secure blockchain because blockchains are public and permissionless, and we only need one. cross-chain swaps expend unnecessary energy and resources when all you really need to verify is whether alice paid bob and if a message is hashed in the database.

the future ai agent economy will be powered by cryptocurrency. equities will be built on it. you will be investing in agents, and they will be investing in you and your businesses.

i think that is what people miss, is when we get a revolution in our information networks and our ledgers it scales our ability to cooperate as it spawns new economic ideologies. the last time we had a transition like this, things got very violent. multiple wars spawned across europe as well as witch hunts. 

we have a better collective memory now, i hope we don't make the same mistakes that lead to such violence of trying to stuff the new way of doing things into old ways of thinking.

what are your thoughts? we have to work together to figure out what our future looks like. the governments and current industry leaders wont be able to, they can't see a future without the lenses of the past. they are too vested in the old world that died over 15 years ago.",0.3456,3740.6361721856033

we’ve been seeing recent news with coins/tokens such as even monero (xmr) being vulnerable to a 51% attack. a large xmr mining group/pool qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the monero network by using the 51% attack. they would have easily succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.

thankfully, ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?

# first of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?

51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.

# is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?

yes!

1.      with at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.

2.      they have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. essentially they can pick and choose, that is a big no no (ahhh i’ve been doing too much baby talk lately irl haha)

3.      the group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! that does not sound good because it isn’t!

4.      the entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! wow, that is a huge red flag!

# proof of work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?

proof of work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.

1.      the greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.

2.      pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.

3.      when chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (recommend reading up on bitcoin gold, they have had multiple 51% attacks…)

4.      slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. the only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…

**just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! that’s cheating!**

# how is proof of stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?

thankfully ethereum has moved on from proof of work to proof of stake with recent upgrades! instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.

1.      in proof of stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as billions of dollars for most high market cap coins or tokens. this is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!

2.      proof of stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! in proof of work, they only lose trust, what is huge improvement!

3.      validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!

4.      socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! users want attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe

ethereum is becoming hyper-modular. its consensus — secured by eth staking — is no longer confined to ethereum itself. eigencloud’s ""restaking"" allows validators to extend eth’s security to other actively validated services (avss). eth becomes programmable gold: the universal security asset underpinning a decentralized internet.

key economic insight:

eth holders: passive maintainers, providing neutral, commodity-like security and earning staking yield.

eigen holders: active governance participants, handling subjective decisions (trusted data, ai outputs, off-chain disputes).

this division keeps ethereum neutral while enabling innovation at its edges.

builders flock to this model. instead of recreating consensus, they plug into ethereum’s trust engine. metrics back this:

$16b+ eth restaked via eigencloud.

40+ live avss, 160+ in development.

$42b tvl across ethereum-settled rollups.

this modular approach replaces web2’s walled gardens with open coordination. integration doesn’t require absorption: services can specialize yet interoperate via ethereum’s neutral base.

risks remain: shared security creates interdependence, and governance of subjective systems is untested. but the direction is clear. ethereum isn’t just scaling: it’s becoming the world’s trust anchor.

eigencloud’s growth isn’t just another trend. it’s proof eth is programmable gold, destined to secure every meaningful digital service.",0.9873,3441.961918943606

bitcoin was digital scarcity - those two words changed society. ethereum was programmable money and we are headed for 1tril+ of stablecoins.

https money will change society again by prying the leverage of information out of the hands of the collective and the eavesdroppers and putting back in the hands of the individual.

\--------------------------------------

# ""tachyon: scaling zcash with oblivious synchronization

zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. they provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. in short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

to enable this, zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. these proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. but the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-snarks](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“zk”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **we can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** we've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**now it’s time to cross the finish line.** i am proposing several protocol changes in zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. the crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that i refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. this new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** in the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. in order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “sapling” upgrade from earlier in zcash's history. back then, we set out to make zk-snarks practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. the sophistication of the sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)proof-carrying data

early in the history of zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-snarks. as mentioned, the [sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. however, zk-snarks are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. this has led to a misconception that zk-snarks are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in zcash.

in reality, we've never actually considered zk-snark verification a barrier to scaling zcash. i once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being snarkpack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

the ultimate tool for scaling zk-snark verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (pcd)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/ct10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind zcash. crudely speaking, pcd allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. this can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

pcd languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. this changed when our team at the electric coin company discovered [halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving pcd with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. as mentioned before, this led to a cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made pcd table stakes for new scalable protocols. pcd can be leveraged to make zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) as we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)communicating state changes

zk-snarks and pcd are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. however, privacy-preserving protocols like zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

there are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* how do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* how do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* how are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-snarks (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. by being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-snarks and pcd.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)shielded notes and commitments

shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [utxos](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in bitcoin. we aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-snark to prove that various rules are being followed. in order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

the commitment hides the note, but the zk-snark can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. this allows the zk-snark proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). in order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. the standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. the user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. the user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. other people use this address to make a payment.
4. the user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

this is how bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. the user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. in private cryptocurrencies like zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. in order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. this simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **as a start, we'll be assuming that zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** the on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over signal chats. in these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. it is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [uri-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

there are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. by moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) in order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. this at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)accumulators and nullifiers

in order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accumulator_(cryptography)). currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. we call this checkpoint an “anchor.” in order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

in order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. this works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-snark proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

if we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **the zk-snark helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** the nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**the scalability bottlenecks that remain in zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)oblivious synchronization

it'll be helpful to recast what a zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

the wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. in each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. in all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. as long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-snark proof and spend the funds. (the wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) this is more or less how our wallets currently work.

my vision for scaling zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-snark proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** this means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. this effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

the result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) as a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

it would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain pcd of the wallet state. this expense is not just due to the cost of creating pcd proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

however, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the pcd proofs) to a third party that i call an **oblivious syncing service**. this service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

we already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homomorphic_encryption) (fhe). **but by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use pcd.** the remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. one would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

in practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. but this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. fortunately, as i'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

this new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. the main changes involved include:

* **wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ecc has already begun exploring the incoporation of uri-encapsulated payments into its zashi mobile wallet. different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the zcash protocol. it also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** this involves implementing and deploying a pcd-based proof aggregation protocol for orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. this can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** this can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in pcd.** i've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. this will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **in-band secret distribution must be removed in zcash.** this can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **the payment protocol should allow wallet pcd state to augment the zk-snark in transactions.** this final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. this can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**i call this the tachyon project for zcash.** i'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. my goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. as with all of our previous network upgrades i'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

crucially, i don't plan to stand in the way of any other zcash protocol improvements while i see tachyon to fruition. i'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and i'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. i also have no reason to believe that tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as crosslink and zsas; in fact, i have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for tachyon.

there are many things i'll be sharing over the coming weeks. i'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that i've developed to be compatible with the orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. this should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

one recent development worth watching is eip-0000, a new proposal co-authored by vitalik buterin and anders elowsson. it introduces something called a unified multidimensional fee market, which sounds complex at first, but the core idea is simple, instead of setting fees separately for gas, blobs, and other resources, users would only need to define a single max fee. the potential benefits? improved capital efficiency, a cleaner user experience, and a foundation for handling additional resource types in the future.

in essence, it’s the kind of infrastructure upgrade that doesn’t make headlines today but could fundamentally improve how people use ethereum, especially as the network leans further into rollups, blob transactions and other modular scaling solutions. it’s a forward looking change that seems designed to quietly improve usability and developer flexibility.

at the same time, ethereum’s 10th anniversary hasn’t gone unnoticed. some platforms are using the occasion to engage their communities, bitget, for example, is running a modest trading campaign tied to eth, which they have termed eth candybomb. it’s nothing massive, but it’s a reminder that ethereum is still at the center of market activity, not just in terms of tech, but also culture and engagement. with a couple of days left in that event, it's interesting to see how even small incentives can drive volume and attention.

put together, it feels like ethereum is entering another phase, one that’s less about hype and more about refinement. eip-0000, subtle trading incentives, anniversary reflections, they all point to an ecosystem that is still evolving, still building and still very much in motion.

what do you make of eip-0000? is it just a background tweak, or could it actually shift the way users and apps interact with ethereum moving forward?",0.9935,3564.680476071617
