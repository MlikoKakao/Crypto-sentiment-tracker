Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have proposed EIP-7983, which aims to introduce a protocol-level cap on transaction gas usage to enhance network security, stability, and zkVM compatibility. The proposal sets a maximum gas limit of 16.77 million for individual transactions, which is designed to:

* Improve resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
* Enhance network stability and predictability
* Increase compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs)

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of HP SURO.ai Token

This survey note provides a comprehensive examination of the HP SURO.ai token, based on the provided screenshot from the Zapper app and additional research conducted as of 12:19 AM CEST on Tuesday, July 08, 2025. The analysis aims to cover all relevant details, ensuring a thorough understanding of the token’s characteristics, market position, and associated risks.

#### Introduction and Context
The user provided a screenshot from the Zapper app, specifically from the URL ""zapper.xyz/nl/token/"", displaying details about the HP SURO.ai token. Zapper is known as a DeFi and NFT tracker, offering real-time data on cryptocurrency tokens, and the screenshot reveals key metrics such as price, liquidity, and holder count. Given the context, this analysis seeks to interpret the screenshot data, verify it against external sources, and assess the token’s viability and risks.

#### Detailed Token Metrics
The screenshot, analyzed through the image, shows the following key metrics for the HP SURO.ai token:
- **Price**: €0.054, indicating the current market value per token in Euros.
- **Liquidity**: €4.44, a critical measure of how easily the token can be bought or sold without affecting its price, which is notably low.
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**: €667M, representing the total value if all tokens were in circulation, though this figure raised questions due to potential discrepancies with other data.
- **Holders**: 6, suggesting very limited adoption and distribution.
- **Total Supply**: Listed as ""123T HF,"" which appears to be a typo or a non-standard metric, possibly intended to mean 123 trillion tokens in a specific unit, but this requires further clarification.

The interface was dark-themed with purple accents, in Dutch, with options to buy (""Kopen"") or sell (""Verkopen"") the token, and included the Ethereum address ""0xbb90...1db1aa"" for verification.

#### Verification with External Sources
To validate the screenshot data, research was conducted using various online resources. The Etherscan page for the token (https://etherscan.io/token/0xbb90626ddcaaca39d88e96ca017b9904821db1aa) listed:
- Price: $0.00, which seems inaccurate compared to the screenshot, possibly indicating outdated or incorrect data.
- Total Supply: 123,456,789,012,345, a figure significantly larger than expected, suggesting potential issues with decimal places or circulating supply.
- Number of Holders: 5, slightly differing from the screenshot’s 6, which may reflect a recent change.

Ethplorer (https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbb90626ddcaaca39d88e96ca017b9904821db1aa) confirmed the total supply as 1.2345678901234E+14 (123,456,789,012,340), aligning with Etherscan, and noted 4 holders, adding to the variability in holder counts.

Attempts to access the official SURO.ai website (https://www.suro.ai/) yielded no readable text, suggesting it may be a landing page or under construction. Further web searches for ""SURO.ai cryptocurrency"" returned results primarily about SUROMA, a different AI-driven crypto platform, and SuRo Capital Corp., a venture capital fund, neither directly related to the token in question.

#### Analysis of Discrepancies
A significant discrepancy was noted in the fully diluted valuation (FDV). The screenshot reported FDV as €667M, but calculations based on the total supply (123,456,789,012,345) and price (€0.054) suggest an FDV of approximately €6.67 trillion, far exceeding the reported figure. This suggests:
- Possible error in the total supply figure on Etherscan/Ethplorer, potentially misrepresenting decimal places.
- The FDV on Zapper might be based on circulating supply rather than total supply, though this wasn’t specified.
- The ""123T HF"" in the screenshot might be a typo, possibly meant to be a different unit or value, contributing to the confusion.

Given the low liquidity (€4.44), it’s plausible that the token is highly illiquid, affecting price stability and making the FDV calculation less reliable. The question mark next to FDV in the screenshot further indicates uncertainty in this metric.

#### Market Position and Adoption
The token’s market position appears weak, with only 6 holders and liquidity of €4.44, indicating limited trading activity and adoption. This is corroborated by the inability to find recent discussions on X (formerly Twitter) about the token, with searches yielding no results, suggesting low public interest or activity. The Ethereum blockchain context aligns with the screenshot, but the lack of comprehensive data on exchanges or market caps (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) reinforces its niche status.

#### Risk Assessment
The low liquidity and few holders are significant red flags for potential investors. Liquidity of €4.44 implies that large transactions could significantly impact the price, making it risky for trading. With only 6 holders, the token lacks widespread adoption, increasing the risk of volatility and potential pump-and-dump schemes. The limited public information, with no clear project details from the official website and discrepancies in reported metrics, adds to the uncertainty, suggesting high risk for investment.

#### Comparative Context
For comparison, other AI-related tokens like Sahara AI (SAHARA) were found in searches, with higher trading volumes and market caps, highlighting the disparity. However, these are distinct projects, and HP SURO.ai’s specifics remain unclear, further emphasizing the need for caution.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
Research suggests that the HP SURO.ai token, as depicted in the screenshot, is a high-risk cryptocurrency with a current price of €0.054, low liquidity of €4.44, and an FDV of €667M, though discrepancies in total supply and holder counts raise questions. It has 6 holders and operates on Ethereum, but the lack of public information and low adoption indicate significant risks. Potential investors should approach with caution, conducting thorough due diligence, and be aware of the potential for high volatility and illiquidity.

1. Bitcoin reclaimed the top spot as the most-used payment crypto, overtaking USDT in Q2. For the full half-year, USDT still led with 24.8% of all transactions, while BTC was close behind at 23.3%. Litecoin continued its climb to 13.6% (up from 13.1% in 2024) and even became the #2 crypto for payments in June!
2. Bitcoin’s blockchain regained the lead, accounting for 23.3% of payment volume. TRON dropped to 21.6% after new MiCA regulations impacted USDT usage. Litecoin and Ethereum both held steady around 13.5%, with Binance Smart Chain at 12%, still favored for cost-effective moves.
3. USDC usage exploded, growing by 337% versus 2024. MiCA regulatory clarity plus multi-chain support fueled this, with USDC payments spreading across Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Base, and Arbitrum. 
4. Merchants are holding more crypto. In 2024, only 27% of merchants settled in crypto rather than fiat. In H1 2025, this jumped to 40.9%, indicating growing comfort treating crypto as a treasury asset.

2025-07-10 08:45:14,"What the typical crypto investor doesn’t understand is that ETH is the gravitational center of the Ethereum system No matter what scaling solution you look at: rollups, validiums, or EigenLayer-enabled systems like MegaETH, everything still ultimately anchors back to onchain Ether.

* Rollups settle their state roots on Ethereum L1, secured by validators who stake ETH and paid for with Ether-denominated fees.
* Validiums keep data offchain but rely on Ethereum to verify proofs, secured again by ETH-staked validators.
* EigenLayer extends Ethereum’s security to new services by restaking ETH itself, making Ether the direct collateral securing new decentralized systems.

No matter how modular the architecture becomes, ETH will remain where value accrues, and what ties everything together.

Yet despite Ether’s central role in scalability, the proliferation of Ethereum scalability solutions has not resulted in a flood of demand for ETH.

The reason is simple: Ethereum’s scalability solutions are still immature. The onchain statistics demonstrate this:

* Ethereum mainnet holds about $121 billion in total value locked.
* The largest Layer 2 solution, Base, holds only about $2 billion — less than 2% of mainnet’s TVL.

The market overwhelmingly still trusts Mainnet. Rollups, restaking, and other modular systems are early in their lifecycle, still earning credibility in security, uptime, and adoption.

As these layers mature and the market gains confidence, more value will migrate outward, but it will remain anchored in Ether.

If Ethereum’s modular scaling roadmap is successfully executed, then orders of magnitude more economic activity will occur on modular extensions of Ethereum than on Mainnet, and in such a scenario, the demand that these extensions will generate for ETH will become appreciable.

Fusaka is expected to be implemented Q4 2025 or early in 2026 and it will pretty much pick up from where Pectra left off.

# Expected upgrades in Fusaka

https://preview.redd.it/q7bay968t2cf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=248258d9e514f1866605cd98e8ae4ea43a1c6c31

This list is subject to change and there may be more EIPs added or removed as we get closer to the release date!

In my opinion, below are upgrades that are important to me that I am excited to look forward to!!!

**Verkle Trees**… Pectra upgrade pretty set up Fusaka for releasing Verkle Trees which are wayyyyyy more efficient of a data structure than the current Merkle Patricia Trees. Verkle trees will allow the Ethereum nodes so they can continue to validate blocks without storing an enormous amount of state data.

# TANGENT TIME!

Like who the hell do they come up with these names? I didn’t know so I had to look it up haha.

Patricia is the Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric.

Merkle Tree is used in cryptography due to the ability of creating a verifiable correlation of all data pieces of a tree which will result in one, single root value to prove the data!

Therefore… Merkle Patricia Tree is both cryptographically verifiable and deterministic! Per the Ethereum foundation

The only way to generate a state root is by computing it from each individual piece of the state, and two states that are identical can be easily proven so by comparing the root hash and the hashes that led to it (*a Merkle proof*)

Verkle trees was named by blending the sound and/or meaning of 2 words: ""Merkle Trees"" and ""Vector commitment"".

Now that we know the naming convention of the current and future Trees, lets continue!

Verkle Trees will be more efficient, enable stateless clients, while making Ethereum lighter, faster, and even more decentralized!

# I’m also looking forward to PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling)!

We saw the blob improvements in the Pectra upgrade and we should expect more in the Fusaka upgrade. Blob sampling will be further improved for rollups, data availability will be enhanced without affecting the node burden, Layer 2s will be further scaled up, and will future-proof Ethereum’s data availability layer. HELL YEAH!

# A third upgrade I am excited for is the EVM Object Format (EOF).

EOF will streamline the process for how smart contracts are created and executed! Essentially, Predictability, gas efficiency, and security will be improved for developers which will affect all users on the blockchain!

Think of Fusaka as Ethereum’s “deep clean and upgrade” phase, polishing the internals of the protocol for long-term future-proof growth. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",0.9969,2807.8623806719115

2025-07-11 01:12:26,"Altcoin Rally and Altseason Signals [Chart showing BTC\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/dt68cslma5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd87a01908addf934ee0739d749c95a788ab8ea5)

As Bitcoin breaks its all-time high again and Ethereum begins to show meaningful rebound trends, the market's focus naturally shifts to the anticipation of whether the altcoin market will now catch fire. However, one must remember that the market's structure operates in contexts beyond mere price rises. The phenomenon known as altseason is not defined by a few specific coins rising; the key lies in how funds flow and how market participants interpret that flow. The current phase seems closer to a period of checking the potential for a shift in capital rotation rather than a short-term rally.

  

# Understanding Bitcoin Dominance as an Altcoin Rally Signal

 

[Chart showing Bitcoin Dominace](https://preview.redd.it/aazyf58qa5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb779ebd45319266c2e76f8bc3231b05e3e06b7)

 

The first criterion for judging market structure is Bitcoin dominance. This indicator distinguishes whether liquidity entering the market is staying solely in Bitcoin or gradually moving to Ethereum and altcoins. A true altseason occurs when funds progressively flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to mid- and small-cap altcoins.

If Bitcoin's dominance forms a peak and turns downward, it can be interpreted as a signal that funds seeking higher returns are starting to move to other sectors. Recently, despite Bitcoin's new highs, dominance has been stagnating or slightly declining, which appears to be a turning point worth watching closely. If this trend persists, it's hard to ignore the possibility that the market's balance is tilting toward altcoins.

 

# The Role of ETH/BTC Ratio in Altseason Signals

 

[Chart showing ETH\/BTC](https://preview.redd.it/y854kmzva5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=338d35e096bce3d26ee605999cef06bf53db2ade)

 

In the same vein, the ETH/BTC ratio plays a crucial role. The real starting point of altseason has always coincided with the rise of this ratio. When Ethereum begins to show strength against Bitcoin, the market accepts it as a signal of structural recovery. This is not just because of its position as the second-largest by market cap, but because Ethereum serves as a central hub connecting DeFi, L2, NFT, and infrastructure ecosystems. Ethereum's strength implies more than just price; it suggests the recovery of demand across the entire alt market.

If the ETH/BTC ratio consolidates at the bottom and continues its rebound, it could be seen as a clear 'first confirmation signal,' providing investors with reason to reassess their altcoin portfolios.

 

# Broader Market Factors Influencing Altcoin Rallies

That said, it's still too early to draw firm conclusions. While funds concentrating in some thematic altcoins are detectable, it's hard to view this as spreading to the entire market. For instance, the recent rises in tokens related to AI, RWA, and DePIN are closer to localized rallies driven by specific narratives rather than a broad alt market uptrend. For an environment worthy of being called altseason to form, widespread concurrent rises must appear across Ethereum-based projects, neglected mid- and small-cap chains, various L1 and L2 ecosystems, and thematic DeFi and NFT projects. Particularly, without accompanying recovery in trading volume and on-chain metrics, the market is unlikely to sustain on short-term expectations alone—a critical perspective is needed here. These indicators serve as keys to gauging market health, steering away from fixation on mere price fluctuations.

Moreover, altseason has always emerged in market cycles after Bitcoin's stable rally. In phases where Bitcoin repeats sharp ups and downs, funds seek stability, which acts as poison to the alt market. Conversely, when BTC stabilizes at a certain high or enters a sideways phase, market participants then turn to risk assets for greater returns, and that's when the altcoin market starts to stir. **The current situation being merely the 'initial stage of fund movement' suggests that excessive optimism should be guarded against.**

 

# External Economic Triggers Like US Rate Cuts

 

[Fed Rate Cut Probabilities from CME FedWatch Tool: Essential Signals for Anticipating Altcoin Rally in H2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/vzyaq610b5cf1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddfe4135c1da0757d53483a0dd29cf7f5e82521)

 

If expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, signs of liquidity re-expansion, and tech stock-led stock market rises align, a full-fledged risk-on flow could form in the cryptocurrency market as well. In such a case, funds are likely to flow sequentially beyond Bitcoin to ETH and the entire altcoin market. **Especially, with institutional funds accessing the market through various channels like stablecoins and BlackRock ETFs, the current flow creates an environment where altseason can be designed on a foundation entirely different from the past**. While these external factors can promote structural changes in the market, considering that their effects may not be immediate calls for flexibility in investment strategies.

Bitcoin's current movements are not significant on the surface. Amid fluctuations of around 2%, it even shows patterns of digesting selling volume in a box range retest phase. Observing whether small buys are gradually entering in this range or if selling resumes at resistance levels is more important. Real bull markets often create vertical rises without giving time to buy. If the market is giving time for many to ponder support and resistance and worry about corrections, it also means it's still early. In other words, it's not too late. Rather, if meaningful corrections emerge in this process, that point could become a buying opportunity. Strategies focusing on accumulating spot positions in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple remain valid. Full-fledged rallies usually start not after people's convictions form, but while doubts linger.

While Bitcoin shows volatility of 1-3% per day, opportunities are more frequently observed on the altcoin side. Especially since the overall market hasn't entered an overheated phase on a spot basis, strategies to accumulate positions in such phases may be reasonable. More important than short-term fluctuations is where funds are residing and in which direction they are moving. This could be the starting point of that transition.

Of course, the futures market now offers environments for significant profits. But looking back at past flows, in phases where bull markets fully materialize, investors maintaining consistent spot portfolios often recorded higher returns. Short-term trading is a means to maximize momentary profits, but when the market starts riding a structural uptrend, long-term holding strategies can work more advantageously. This is even more so in phases where market vitality is reviving like now.

Particularly, fixating on daily charts, immersing in daily market updates on cafes or communities, or relying on overly amplified macroeconomic analyses to time buys often leads to getting caught in FOMO psychology. But the market doesn't wait for such interpretations or predictions. Directions don't change immediately just because rates rise slightly or inflation stabilizes somewhat, and in fact, Bitcoin has broken new highs amid such debates. This approach may seem analytical on the surface, but in reality, it tends to lead to fixation on instant profits, pushing oneself into increasingly unstable states. Above all, even when the market starts to grasp a full direction at crucial points, most are not prepared to ride that flow.

A single trading mistake can damage an account, or conversely, missing one opportunity can leave one watching the entire bull market from the sidelines. Given that the current market environment favors structural and long-term strategies more, taking such risks seems unwarranted. Reflecting back, investors who consistently held spot or some futures from April onward would now be in sufficient profit zones. The likelihood is high that this yielded far better results than repeated frantic trading daily. Ultimately, attempts to time the market often lead to frequent failures, **whereas those riding structural uptrends gain the effects of compounding through time and direction. Approaches that are not sustainable or recoverable can become causes for pushing oneself out of the market even in bull phases.**

For some, this phase may be a time to prepare for new opportunities, while for others, it could be interpreted as a section to trim positions or reduce risks. But what's important is clearly establishing one's strategy and building a portfolio accordingly. While it's not yet possible to assert what flow's starting point this is, it seems sufficient timing as preparation to close out the fourth quarter of this year with meaningful profits. Approach it with a strategic perspective, without being too hasty but without missing the flow.

2025-07-13 09:17:23,"The Role of Memecoins in Today’s Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Memecoins—cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes and viral culture—have evolved from niche novelties to significant players in the cryptocurrency landscape. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and platforms like *Pump<>fun* exemplify their multifaceted impact. As of July 2025, memecoins continue to drive innovation, adoption, and market dynamics across various dimensions, despite their speculative nature. As you may know based on some of my comments and posts, I believe memecoins are a key driving force and they will continue to propel blockchain/CryptoCurrency innovations to audience that desire a soft landing platform to crypto. I have put together this post to portray key examples and recent developments.

## Driving User Adoption and Onboarding
Memecoins serve as an accessible entry point for new crypto users. Their low price points and viral appeal attract retail investors who might otherwise shy away from complex DeFi or NFT projects. Dogecoin, launched in 2013, gained mainstream traction through endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, peaking at a $90 billion market cap in 2021. Its simplicity—built on a Bitcoin fork—made it a gateway for millions to explore crypto wallets and exchanges. Similarly, Shiba Inu, an Ethereum-based token, onboarded users via its “Doge Killer” branding, reaching a $40 billion market cap in 2021. By 2025, Bonk on Solana has drawn thousands to its ecosystem, with its playful dog-themed narrative boosting Solana wallet creation by ~15% during its 2023 peak, ~ **source** Solana Foundation data.

Recent events, like Pump-fun’s $500 million PUMP token sale recently, highlight memecoins’ onboarding power. Pump-fun gamified launchpad, which enabled over 5 million meme token creations on Solana *[according to on-chain stats], attracted both creators and speculators, driving platform revenue to $715 million by mid-2025. This accessibility fosters broader crypto adoption, particularly among younger demographics.

## Boosting Blockchain Activity and Liquidity
Memecoins significantly increase transaction volumes and liquidity on their host blockchains. Dogecoin’s 2021 surge drove transaction spikes on its network, with daily volumes reaching 1.5 million transactions - [*Bitinfocharts*] . Shiba Inu’s trading on Ethereum contributed ~10-15% to the chain’s transaction volume during its 2021 peak, according to Dune Analytics. Bonk’s 2023 rise on Solana similarly boosted network activity [a period when many including holders like me were very skeptical about Solana future after many network halts and restarts], with daily transactions hitting 5million+ during its hype cycle. These surges elevate gas fees and validator revenue, strengthening blockchain economics.

Pumpdotfun success underscores this trend. Its Solana-based platform, with more than $20 million in monthly revenue as of July 2025, has increased SOL demand and liquidity. The PUMP token sale, selling 125 billion tokens in 12 minutes across major exchanges like Bybit and Kraken, amplified Solana’s market visibility, contributing to a ~20% market cap increase in Q2 2025, per CoinGecko.

## Fostering Innovation and Ecosystem Growth
- Memecoins spur innovation by encouraging developers to build supporting infrastructure. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem expanded to include ShibaSwap, a DEX, and NFT integrations, enhancing Ethereum’s DeFi landscape. Bonk’s success on Solana led to tools like PumpSwap, a DEX launched by Pump-fun in 2025, which shares 50% of trading revenue with token creators. This creator-friendly model has driven developer interest, with Solana’s dApp ecosystem growing more than 17% since Pump-d-fun’s January 2024 launch, - DappRadar.

- Memecoins also inspire novel mechanics. Pumps bonding curve model, where token prices rise as buys increase, and its liquidity-locking feature have set new standards for token launches, reducing rug pull risks. These innovations strengthen blockchain ecosystems, attracting more projects and users. A feature that many standalone blockchains lack even with today's crypto market awareness. 

## Cultural and Social Impact
Memecoins leverage internet culture to create and engaged communities, fostering loyalty and advocacy. Dogecoin’s “tipping” culture on platforms like Reddit built a grassroots following, while SHIB’s “SHIBArmy” drove social media hype, with over 1 million X[Twitter] followers by 2025. Bonk’s community-centric airdrops in 2023 revitalized Solana’s ecosystem post-FTX collapse, boosting morale and adoption.

## Challenges and Risks
Despite their benefits, memecoins pose risks too and it will be very silly to not acknowledge these risks. Their speculative nature fuels volatility—Pump*d*fun’s trading volume dropped 75-80% since January 2025 - *[DeFiLlama]*, reflecting market fickleness. Scams, like BSC’s Squid Game token rug pull in 2021, highlight vulnerabilities. Overreliance on memecoin hype can also skew blockchain development toward short-term gains, potentially deterring serious projects. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern, as memecoins’ speculative appeal could invite crackdowns, impacting broader markets.

## My take on memecoins
Memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and platforms like Pump-fun, etc are more than fleeting trends—they drive adoption, liquidity, innovation, and cultural engagement in the crypto ecosystem. While their volatility and risks warrant caution, their ability to onboard users, boost blockchain activity, and inspire new tools is undeniable. As of July 2025, memecoins remain a dynamic force, shaping cryptocurrency’s growth and mainstream appeal, with Pump-fun’s $500 million token sale vocalising their enduring impact. However, sustainable growth requires balancing their speculative allure with robust ecosystem development.",0.999,2953.9141264221453
2025-07-13 11:49:39,"How Restaked ETH is Being Used to Build a 'Supreme Court' for Crypto, Judging Everything from AI to Oracles For years, blockchains have excelled at enforcing objective truth: cryptographic, provable, indisputable. But as we push into richer domains like verifiable AI, decentralized social media, and advanced oracle networks, we’re hitting a wall. These new frontiers bring subjective questions that can’t be resolved by code alone.

This is where a new architectural pattern emerges: layered trust. At its core, it combines the hard guarantees of Ethereum with the flexibility of human judgment.

A leading example is the Verifiable Cloud (EigenCloud on @EigenLayer). Its security model has two distinct layers:

• Restaked ETH enforces objective rules — was the data posted? did the computation execute? — with automatic slashing for failure. No interpretation needed.
• EIGEN handles subjective disputes: was an oracle’s source reliable? did an AI’s output meet agreed standards? — via decentralized arbitration.

The brilliance lies in the separation of concerns. Ethereum’s validator set, amplified through restaking, forms an unshakable foundation. On top of this foundation, EIGEN provides a social layer for gray areas where algorithmic certainty ends and human discernment begins.

The ""slash-and-fork"" mechanism is key here. When disputes arise, stakers vote. Malicious actors are slashed; honest participants fork to the correct state. Crucially, this mechanism works because it inherits the economic weight of Ethereum. Without ETH’s security budget underpinning it, the system wouldn’t hold.

This is the crux: the subjective layer only has value because it’s anchored to Ethereum’s objective guarantees. This layered approach could unlock decentralized governance, AI moderation, and trust-minimized data services — all backed by the most battle-tested security in crypto.

It also reframes staking itself. No longer just a passive yield generator, restaked ETH becomes an active force, providing programmable trust to power the emerging verifiable internet.

If it works, we could see an entire class of oracles, AI agents, data-availability layers, and even rollups renting Ethereum’s security instead of bootstrapping their own. This composability makes ETH not just a currency or a commodity but the base layer for digital truth.

2025-07-16 12:56:03,"Solana and BNB Just Posted One of Blockchain’s Busiest Weeks Ever and Here’s What I Noticed This past week, I saw something interesting across the chains. Total blockchain activity hit a new record. Over 342 million transactions happened in just seven days. That’s the highest weekly number I’ve come across so far.  
  
Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron led the activity. Solana especially stood out. It alone handled almost 60 percent of all transactions. That spike didn’t just happen out of nowhere. A lot of it came from meme coins launching non-stop on Solana platforms like LetsBonk and Pumpfun. These tokens are highly speculative but they’re pulling in a ton of new users. The chain has been nonstop busy.  
  
BNB Chain had a smaller slice of the volume, around 19 percent, but it still has the most applications built on it. It covers everything from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and that mix helps keep users active and money flowing. It also got a recent speed boost after the Maxwell upgrade, which reduced block time to around 0.75 seconds. It’s smoother now and feels more responsive.  
  
Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron are also still among the most used chains daily. Tron even passed Ethereum in daily USDT volume. It’s mostly large whale trades plus over a million smaller retail transactions happening every day. That kind of consistent flow shows that these chains actually have real communities using them.  
  
Sure, some of this spike is probably driven by speculation and hype but even with that, 342 million transactions in one week is a serious number. It shows more people are actively using blockchains rather than just watching from the sidelines.

Just asked a LLM to analyse the above.


Navigating the CLARITY Act: Which Blockchains Are Most Likely to Be ""Digital Commodities""

The proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (CLARITY Act) is gaining traction in the US House of Representatives this ""Crypto Week"" (mid-July 2025). This bill aims to bring much-needed regulatory certainty by establishing a clear framework for digital assets — primarily by defining ""digital commodities"" and assigning their oversight to the CFTC.

A core component is the ""maturity test"", which assesses if a blockchain system and its native asset are truly decentralized and utility-driven. It generally looks for:

Decentralization: The system is ""not controlled by any person or group of persons under common control.""

Utility-Driven: The token's value is ""substantially derived from the use and functioning of the blockchain system.""

Broadly Distributed: Ownership by ""certain holders"" must be under 20% of outstanding supply.


I've put together a breakdown of how major blockchain projects stack up, ranked from most to least likely to qualify as a ""digital commodity"" under this framework.


---

🔹 Bitcoin (BTC) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Unquestionably decentralized — no issuer, widely distributed mining and nodes

Clear utility as a store of value and medium of exchange

Fair launch and fixed supply (21M BTC)

Governance is slow, organic, and highly decentralized


Challenges:

Mining pool concentration

ASIC manufacturer centralization (minor)



---

🔹 Ethereum (ETH) — Very High Likelihood

Strengths:

Decentralized validator set post-Merge (PoS)

Multiple, independent clients (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, etc.)

Essential for DeFi, NFTs, staking — strong native utility

Open governance via EIPs and dev calls


Challenges:

Lido dominance in staked ETH may raise concerns

Historical ICO (but long since matured)



---

🔹 Cardano (ADA) — High Likelihood

Strengths:

Many stake pools; designed for high decentralization

Voltaire era introducing full on-chain governance

ADA used for fees, staking, and smart contracts

Good validator distribution


Challenges:

Past reliance on IOHK (declining as governance matures)



---

🔹 Algorand (ALGO) — High-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Pure PoS allows wide participation

Growing community-driven governance

Utility includes ASAs, fees, and staking

Technically scalable and efficient


Challenges:

Past centralization of relay nodes

Foundation’s large token allocation may trigger scrutiny



---

🔹 Internet Computer (ICP) — Moderate-High Likelihood

Strengths:

On-chain DAO (NNS) governs the protocol

ICP used for computation, storage gas, node rewards

Ambitious goal to decentralize the internet itself


Challenges:

DFINITY Foundation’s role at genesis still lingers

Specialized hardware for node providers may limit diversity

Controversial initial unlock raises ""value from others"" concerns



---

🔹 Hedera (HBAR) — Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Governing Council includes global enterprises (Google, IBM, etc.)

HBAR used for smart contracts, fees, and staking

Gradual roadmap to permissionless nodes

Built with regulatory compliance in mind


Challenges:

Council may be viewed as ""common control""

Initial token distribution favors early insiders



---

🔹 Sui (SUI) — Low-Moderate Likelihood

Strengths:

Unique object-centric design, strong dApp utility

DPoS governance allows community involvement

Used for fees, staking, and governance


Challenges:

High hardware and capital requirements limit validator diversity

Large allocation to Mysten Labs and the Sui Foundation

Risk of perceived centralization and control



---

🔹 Solana (SOL) — Low Likelihood

Strengths:

Extremely fast, low fees, vibrant dApp ecosystem

SOL used for fees, staking, governance


Challenges:

Validator costs are prohibitively high (centralization risk)

Network outages + coordinated restarts = potential control concerns

Dominance of a single client implementation

Large initial allocations to insiders and VCs



---

🔍 Final Thoughts on the CLARITY Act

Final Wording Matters: The bill is still evolving in Congress and may be amended (especially with CBDC bans in play).

Regulator Discretion: The SEC and CFTC will apply the ""maturity test"" case by case.

Ongoing Progress Matters: Projects increasing decentralization, validator access, and community control can improve their chances over time.

It’s faster for transactions than ethereum (though not as fast as many other layer 1 protocols). I’d suspect a fair amount of the Tron popularity with USDT is due to poor KYC protocols on Tron platforms. 
 
Tron has always been associated with shady practices and the general shadiness of Justin Sun. 
 
However it now seems Justin Sun is in with the Trump admin due to large purchases of the $TRUMP token. The SEC has dropped its investigation of Sun. Tron, the company, is going public via a reverse merger with SRM entertainment using Eric Trump’s company.

I'm looking for some advice on the best network to **HODL USDC**. I want to build a long-term reserve of USDC, and I already have a **hardware wallet**, which gives me great security for my private keys. However, I'm really torn about which network to use for storing my USDC.

After some research, I understand that keeping USDC on the **Ethereum network** would likely be the most secure option, given its unparalleled robustness and decentralization. The downside, though, is the significantly higher cost for sending and moving funds on Ethereum. This makes it quite unattractive for smaller amounts, especially during peak times like a **bull market**, when gas fees can skyrocket.

A promising alternative I've been considering is storing my USDC on **Polygon**. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Polygon offers much lower transaction fees and faster confirmations.

My main question is: Does the added security of Ethereum justify the high costs for a long-term reserve, or would the practicality and cost-effectiveness of Polygon be an acceptable compromise, especially since I'm already using the protection of a hardware wallet?

I'd really appreciate your insights on this balance between cost and security for HODLing USDC. What's your recommendation? Thanks in advance!",0.9827,3615.845134749492

2025-07-18 23:22:30,"I’ve been buying Hex since 2021… And it’s forever gone down.

I am pure degenerate.

I believe this coin has the legs to run, the community to support it, and the founder to bootstrap it.

I believe Richard Heart moved the 80k BTC.

I believe when he said he mined 300k BTC in 2011 back when he live-streamed in 2019 era.

I believe we will see the most epic pump after Eth tops.

I think the hex community has received the most hate and ridicule, but throughout everything, they are still here and believe harder than ever that Richard Heart made the best crypto products (and is still making them…. Liberty finance . Swap)

I’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what Richard Heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.

1) Bitcoin.  People wanted to earn yield, so they gave their Bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  Guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their BTC.  Guess who warned you of Gemini, Celcius, FTX, etc?  Richard.

He actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in December 2019.  Which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.

So this guy Richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  Meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  Just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  

The money used to buy ASICs, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  A hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.

So hex is born.

2) Ethereum.  Best product that crypto has offered.  Period.  Bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  It can’t do sheet.  Ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  

But them gas fees yo.  Every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.

Hence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  It’s not some L2 that is centralized on one dudes node.

It’s world wide. No one can turn it off.  And it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.  So now Ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while Pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  Best of all worlds.  

Pulsechain is born.

3) Uniswap.  Did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  There’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but Hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  All UNI token holders are getting kucked.

So Richard made PLSX.  Buy and burn features TURNED ON, and cannot be turned off.  It’s the drunken michael Saylor buying the PLSX token forevermore with every swap that occurs on Pulsechain. 

With $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, AND everybody hates the chain.  Imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…


So these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  But Richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.


RH believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.

What other meme coin can boast such stats?

I like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  Freedom to transact.

2025-07-20 22:36:19,"How Hyperliquid is Rewriting the Rules of Capital Allocation # The Greatest Buyback Experiment in Private Equity History: How Hyperliquid is Rewriting the Rules of Capital Allocation

**In an era where Apple's $110 billion buyback barely moves markets and private equity firms struggle with record-long holding periods, a decentralized exchange has quietly orchestrated the most revolutionary buyback program in financial history.**

While traditional markets celebrated another record-breaking year of corporate buybacks—with S&P 500 companies returning $942.5 billion to shareholders in 2024—a different kind of experiment was unfolding in the digital asset space. Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, has created what can only be described as the greatest buyback experiment in the history of private equity: a fully automated, revenue-driven capital recycling engine that makes traditional buyback programs look antiquated by comparison.

# The Magnitude of the Machine

Hyperliquid's Assistance Fund has amassed more than $1 billion in HYPE tokens, creating a major capital recycling engine where 97% of the fees collected from users are used to buy back HYPE. To put this in perspective, the platform recently purchased $4.72 million worth of HYPE in a single day, with an average price of $47.43, while maintaining strong buyback mechanics of $2 million per day.

This isn't just impressive—it's unprecedented. When we examine the scale relative to the platform's size and age, Hyperliquid's buyback intensity dwarfs anything seen in traditional private equity. The platform has accumulated over $77 million in USDC inflows to its Assistance Fund, with over $25 million in the past month alone, translating to an average daily buyback of approximately $1 million worth of HYPE.

# Beyond the Numbers: A New Paradigm

What makes Hyperliquid's approach revolutionary isn't just the scale—it's the mechanism itself. Unlike traditional private equity buybacks that depend on discretionary board decisions, market timing, and complex approval processes, Hyperliquid operates like a protocol-funded participant, always bidding, always buying.

Using an average contract trading fee of 0.0225%, with profits distributed between HLP and AF in a 46:54 split, approximately 54% ($18.79 million) enters the AF fund to buy back HYPE, translating into an annualized net profit of $225.5 million. This creates what amounts to an auto-scarcity mechanism that not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity, creating additional upward pressure on token price.

# The Private Equity Context

To understand why this matters, consider the current state of traditional private equity. The median holding period for a private equity-backed company reached an all-time high of seven years in 2023 but experienced a dramatic decline in 2024 to 5.9 years, while private equity firms hold more than 28,000 assets, 40% of which have been held for longer than four years.

Traditional private equity struggles with what economists call the ""liquidity paradox""—the longer you hold assets, the more difficult it becomes to achieve efficient exits. Firms are sitting on record amounts of dry powder while facing prolonged holding periods that frustrate limited partners and distort returns.

# The Hyperliquid Solution

Hyperliquid has solved this paradox through what could be called ""perpetual liquidity generation."" Rather than waiting for exit opportunities, the platform creates continuous value through its buyback mechanism. The automatic nature of the Assistance Fund's buyback activity, directly fueled by protocol revenue, creates a transparent and programmatic link between the platform's operational success and mechanisms designed to support the token's value.

This approach mirrors the best practices of traditional private equity—focusing on operational excellence and cash generation—while eliminating the industry's biggest weakness: exit dependency. Every day of successful trading activity translates directly into buyback pressure, creating what Doug Colkitt, founder of Ambient Finance, calls alignment between ""a project's tokenomics and user incentives regardless of prevailing market conditions"".

# The Performance Proof

The results speak for themselves. Hype has soared to an all-time high of $42 and is up 65% in the last month, beating Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. More importantly, the Assistance Fund is sitting on a trove of $680 million in paper gains after buying Hype tokens at an average price of $14.

Hyperliquid's futures trading volume has continued its upward trajectory, recording $443 billion year-to-date in 2024, with November alone seeing a record-high trading volume of $77 billion, capturing an impressive 45% market share in the crypto futures DEX market. This organic growth, combined with the buyback mechanism, creates a virtuous cycle that traditional private equity can only dream of achieving.

# Why This Changes Everything

Traditional private equity operates on a model of buy, improve, and exit. This creates inherent tension between value creation and value realization. Hyperliquid has created a fourth option: buy, improve, and continuously compound through systematic buybacks.

The implications extend far beyond crypto. By purchasing and burning HYPE tokens from the market, supply contracts, and the proportional value of remaining tokens naturally increases. This auto-scarcity mechanism not only incentivizes holders to delay selling but also instills the expectation of further scarcity.

This model addresses three critical challenges facing modern private equity:

**1. The Exit Bottleneck:** Rather than depending on IPO markets or strategic buyers, value is continuously realized through buybacks.

**2. The LP Patience Problem:** Instead of waiting years for distributions, token holders see continuous value accretion through supply reduction.

**3. The Scale Efficiency Question:** The more successful the platform becomes, the more aggressive the buybacks become, creating exponential rather than linear value creation.

# The Broader Revolution

Other crypto projects like Jupiter and dYdX have similar plans, with estimates suggesting various protocols will repurchase hundreds of millions worth of tokens annually. But Hyperliquid stands apart in both scale and execution sophistication.

Hyperliquid stands apart from the rest of the ecosystem, with no true direct comparison. The project's development has been entirely self-financed, fostering organic and sustainable growth. The revenues generated by the protocol are among the highest in the industry and are entirely reinvested into HYPE buybacks through the Assistance Fund.

# The Future of Capital Allocation

What we're witnessing with Hyperliquid isn't just a clever financial engineering trick—it's the emergence of a new paradigm for capital allocation that could reshape how we think about value creation and distribution in private markets.

The traditional private equity model, with its dependence on external exit markets and discrete liquidity events, suddenly looks as antiquated as dividend-paying utilities in a world of growth stocks. Unlike dividend models, where scarcity is contingent on individual reinvestment decisions, Hyperliquid's automatic burn system reinforces the network's tokenomics without relying on user behavior.

# The Bottom Line

While Apple makes headlines with $110 billion buyback announcements and private equity firms struggle with extended holding periods, Hyperliquid has quietly built the most sophisticated capital recycling machine in financial history. It's not just the largest buyback experiment in private equity—it's the blueprint for how capital allocation should work in the digital age.

The question isn't whether this model will be copied—it's how quickly traditional private equity will adapt to remain relevant in a world where automated, performance-linked buybacks have redefined what efficient capital allocation looks like.

In an industry built on the promise of superior returns through operational excellence, Hyperliquid hasn't just delivered—it's created a new category entirely. This isn't just the greatest buyback experiment in private equity history; it's the beginning of private equity's next evolution.

We’re joining forces with r/ethtrader for a community-driven donation drive to support the legal defense of Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash. This isn’t just about one developer — it’s about defending privacy, open-source development, and the very principles that make Ethereum and crypto possible.

# Why This Matters

Roman is facing years in prison for publishing open-source privacy software — tools anyone could freely use. At the time, the only official guidance (from FinCEN) said developers of such software weren’t money transmitters. Yet in August 2023, U.S. authorities arrested him, charging conspiracy, unlicensed money transmission, and sanctions violations.

The DOJ’s narrative misrepresents the facts:

* Roman and his co-founder ""never operated a service"" — they only published code.
* They added filters in their web wallet code to block sanctioned addresses but couldn’t control forks of their software.
* The prosecution hinges on a ""novel legal theory"": that ""money transmission"" applies even without custody of funds.

This case sets a dangerous precedent: if developers can be punished for misuse of open-source code, innovation and privacy in crypto are at risk. The First Amendment protects code as speech — yet prosecutors treat it like an afterthought, even resorting to absurd analogies (comparing money transmission to ""a frying pan conducting heat"").

# The Situation Now

Roman’s trial began July 14, 2025, in Manhattan. What was expected to last 2 weeks may now stretch 3-4, with skyrocketing costs for expert witnesses, research, and legal fees. The defense fund urgently needs ""another $1.5M"" to sustain the fight.

The Ethereum Foundation has stepped up with ""$500K"" and will ""match community donations up to $750K"" — doubling your impact.

the thing that gets me is how much pushback there still is in academic spaces. like these same professors teaching about ""modern portfolio theory"" but refuse to acknowledge that digital assets might have a place in diversified portfolios. meanwhile kids who graduated 5 years ago are buying houses with their crypto gains

\--------------------------------------------

  
**""This is not financial advice and just my personal analysis. Please do your own research.**

I simply share my analysis of why I think that Zcash (ZEC) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

It's also not meant as input for short-term trading, I'm not interested in that and I think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

# Starting point

Bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken Saylor could spend.

The narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (SoV) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space/) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

The launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF [IBIT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7B AUM is considered the most successful ETF launch *in history*.

The U.S. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**Nothing stops this train.**

That means number go up for Bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. With gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the S&P500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

Ethereum and Solana have both been underperforming Bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

Retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) recently raising $500M in 12 minutes. Or $600M, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

Crypto Twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much Bitcoin is pumping. Retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on X.

# A privacy renaissance?

Meanwhile, the word on the street is that AML regulations are getting out of control. It's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

People have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

Interacted with a mixer six years go? Please explain yourself.

The EU is leading the way again in regulation with MiCA, the only area where the EU seems to be leading these days. This lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

# Why should privacy coins outperform?

I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin has been institutionalized. Bitcoin Maxis are cheering for Michael Saylor, ETFs, and even strategic Bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the Bitcoins in the reserve. Or the ones from whom the Bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

There are various L2 solution trying to add privacy to Bitcoin, I'll write in another post why I don't think these will add privacy to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. I hope I'm wrong, though, and projects like [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [Cashu](https://cashu.me/) get mainstream adoption.

The problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

Swapping Bitcoin for Monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, Monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while Bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

So was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

Will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

# Will Bitcoin dominate forever?

As I said in the beginning, Bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and Bitcoin got it.

The only thing that Bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good L1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. We can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. It's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the L1 protocol layer, given the ossification of Bitcoin.

Currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): The leading privacy coin Monero has only \~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, Zcash, only \~1/3300th.

So why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? Why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

It's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually Monero, over Bitcoin. [Archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetyp_Market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was Monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250M Euro in revenue.

So why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? And while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. Why should that change?

* The market cap of Bitcoin is $2.3T
* The market cap of gold is $22T
* Total global asset value is [\~$1,000T](https://x.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1919385198795338165)
* That is, the market cap of Bitcoin is \~1/10th of gold and \~0.2% of total assets
* The market cap of all privacy coins ([CoinGecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4B
* The market cap of Monero is $6B
* The market cap of Zcash is $0.7B
* Undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10T, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
* That is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than \~0.1% of offshore wealth**

Due to increasing AML regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

Quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. That's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. This will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider DeFi ecosystem.

Another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

All the KYC & AML regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

Users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the Ledger email leak that happened years ago.

So hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

# Zcash vs. Monero

As has been argued in [another post](https://frankbraun.org/t-addr), Zcash has better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of ZEC in circulation are currently in shielded pools. That's quickly increasing due to the ""Zashi effect"" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [Keystone](https://keyst.one/). Ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

Holding ZEC in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for ZEC. It's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

Monero currently has the lead over Zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare Zcash shielded transaction to default Monero transactions. At least until FCMP++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of FCMP++ over zero-knowledge proofs.

# The importance of UX

Monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while Zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. Assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but I want to share an observation I made over the years.

Open-source has been really effective in delivering superior ""base layer"" infrastructure components: The Linux kernel, the GCC compiler, various programming languages, etc.

But it's usually very bad at delivering world-class UX, these usually come from companies, Apple being the most famous example.

I think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great UX. Nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great UX needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

Given that Zcash currently has the better base technology (Monero is catching up with FCMP++), the war for the end user is won in the UX, and there [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/) under Josh Swihart is currently leading the way with [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

The typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great UX and already has a Ledger.

# Privacy is necessary for commerce

Most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. Using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

The term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: Making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

You can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is.

For example, there is good reason why a lot of HR departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. If you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

Bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like GDPR) exist for a reason. I'm not a lawyer, but I would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**Commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

Just as the World Wide Web (using the HTTP protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to HTTPS) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. See also: [Zcash, the HTTPS of Blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in January 2020).

And while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

For a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

# Halvings

Zcash is about two halving cycles behind Bitcoin. While inflation in Bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in Zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of \~12.5% to \~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in November 2024. This might serve as a catalyst for Zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

The next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely \~2%.

And after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub \~1%.

Bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. Zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. But from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

# Tracking

Of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. But picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

* BTC: 118844.42 USD
* XMR: 334.72 USD
* ZEC: 44.23 USD

Let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

# Conclusion

If the network effects of Bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both Monero and Zcash should underperform Bitcoin.

If privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both Monero and Zcash should overperform Bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising \~80% of it (according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

Given that Zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of Monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making UX advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both Monero and Bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

Which is why I consider Zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**It has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** Holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. It's a great flywheel.

The largest risks I see is that Monero quickly catches on with FCMP++ and better UX, or that the recent quick UX advances in Zcash slow down. For example, due to lack of funding for Electric Coin Company, because recent [changes to the Zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ECC doesn't automatically receive ""protocol funding"" anymore.

Commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

I guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

Until then — stay safe out there anon!""

2025-07-24 21:01:33,"We are in a renaissance and I think the future will play out a lot like the last one. I'm one of the earlier Bitcoin investors. I got into it because I saw people moving money or value around without a bank, and I figured it was going to change everything. I got into Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum very early. The only one I've really held onto is Bitcoin, which comprises most of my portfolio.



I run an AI agent firm, and I don't think people are really ready for the collision of these two technologies. Let me explain why. We're in a renaissance. Looking at the last renaissance around the 1500s, there was an intersection between two technological revolutions: information networks and ledgers. Books could disseminate new ideas, which disrupted the Catholic Church's monopoly on the Bible, leading to the Protestant Reformation. Subsequently, Protestants fled Europe and came to America. Double-entry accounting gave birth to nation-states, stock markets, corporatism, and public stock exchanges. **It completely transformed our world and scaled our ability to cooperate.**

We have this same thing now, a financial reformation, where the people no longer need the permission from an elite heriarchy to access what is essentially just a book. An important one, that can only have entries appended to. It is a revolution in how clearing is done.

I define a renaissance as an intersection of innovations in our lists and information networks. Today, we've had numerous innovations. SQL and relational databases have transformed our world as a list powered at light speed. The internet, telegram, telephone, and social media have revolutionized information networks. Now we have cryptocurrency, which is an innovation in the ledger, and LLMs (Large Language Models), creating a new intersection of technological disruptions to our civilization's core pillars.

A notable author to explore on this topic is Yuval Noah Harari. These technologies cannot fit in the old world or old way of thinking because they give birth to new economic ideologies. Just as double-entry accounting gave us capitalism, cryptocurrency will give us something else.

I believe cryptocurrencies will ultimately converge into one because these systems are identical - they are decentralized verification systems where you put a message in, and everyone on the network can verify whether your message is there or not. All 15,000 cryptocurrencies perform the same function.

AI agents won't be using bank accounts; they'll be using cryptocurrency. They will make decisions and purchases, and I don't think people realize how disruptive this combination of technologies will be. They will likely settle on one secure blockchain because blockchains are public and permissionless, and we only need one. Cross-chain swaps expend unnecessary energy and resources when all you really need to verify is whether Alice paid Bob and if a message is hashed in the database.

The future AI agent economy will be powered by cryptocurrency. Equities will be built on it. You will be investing in agents, and they will be investing in you and your businesses.

I think that is what people miss, is when we get a revolution in our information networks AND our ledgers it scales our ability to cooperate as it spawns new economic ideologies. The last time we had a transition like this, things got very violent. Multiple wars spawned across Europe as well as witch hunts. 

We have a better collective memory now, I hope we don't make the same mistakes that lead to such violence of trying to stuff the new way of doing things into old ways of thinking.

What are your thoughts? We have to work together to figure out what our future looks like. The governments and current industry leaders wont be able to, they can't see a future without the lenses of the past. They are too vested in the old world that died over 15 years ago.

If you look at the manifesto, in phase II you will see involves a decentralized compute network overlayed with a privacy focused crypto-currency.

Initially I was thinking of developing my own crypto-currency.  Monero is great, but I don't like the technical implementation with the multiple daemons -- wallet, server node, clinet, etc.  Definitely not doing Ethereum, as I hate that protocol.

Have been developing bitcoin related systems since 2010 though, so know the protocol inside out.  Even developed my own node once.  Haven't kept up with all the latest BIPs, but the base protocol remains the same.

To save time and energy, almost thinking instead of developing my own crypto currency, might be best to just use bitcoin instead.  What do you think?

– programmable money  
– smart contracts  
– open dApp platforms

While others collapsed post-ICO, ETH evolved.

📊 Milestones:

• **2016** \- DAO hack → chain split → Ethereum Classic  
• **2017** \- ICO mania → ATH $1.4K  
• **2020** \- DeFi summer → TVL surges, gas crisis  
• **2022** \- Merge → PoW to PoS  
• **2024–2025** \- L2s, restaking, EigenLayer dominance

Today ETH isn’t just a blockchain it’s the foundation of L2 rollups, staking economies, RWA scaling, and modular design.

It’s not perfect. Gas remains an issue. UX still sucks. But structurally, Ethereum is a proven settlement layer.

We’ve been seeing recent news with coins/tokens such as even Monero (XMR) being vulnerable to a 51% attack. A large XMR mining group/pool Qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the Monero network by using the 51% attack. They would have EASILY succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.

https://preview.redd.it/oky2q83aluff1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef7568d83918a7e35b526ef15996cf4476190a1

Thankfully, Ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?

# First of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?

51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.

# Is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?

Yes!

1.      With at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.

2.      They have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. Essentially they can pick and choose, that is a BIG NO NO (ahhh I’ve been doing too much baby talk lately IRL haha)

3.      The group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! That does not sound good because IT ISN’T!

4.      The entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! WOW, that is a HUGE red flag!

# Proof of Work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?

Proof of Work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.

1.      The greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.

2.      Pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.

3.      When chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (Recommend reading up on Bitcoin Gold, they have had MULTIPLE 51% attacks…)

4.      Slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. The only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…

**Just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! THAT’S CHEATING!**

# How is Proof of Stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?

Thankfully Ethereum has moved on from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with recent upgrades! Instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.

1.      In Proof of Stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for most high market cap coins or tokens. This is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!

2.      Proof of Stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! In Proof of Work, they only lose trust, what is HUGE improvement!

3.      Validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!

4.      Socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! Users WANT attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe

2025-07-31 19:14:00,"If DeFi is the future, why do so many Bitcoin believers reject Ethereum and other altcoins? Decentralization has always been a central promise of the crypto world. The idea of removing intermediaries, building open financial systems, and empowering individuals is what drew many into Bitcoin in the first place.

But today, much of that decentralized functionality,ike lending, trading, stablecoins, and DAOs, is being developed primarily on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. These ecosystems are creating real use cases that go beyond just storing value. They are expanding what crypto can do.

And yet, a significant portion of the Bitcoin community rejects these developments. Many BTC holders dismiss Ethereum and most altcoins as too centralized, too risky, or simply unnecessary. Their belief is that Bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized asset, is all that truly matters.

This raises an important question: if people truly believe in the power of decentralization, why oppose the platforms that are actually building decentralized applications? Could it be that Ethereum and altcoins represent the next evolution of crypto, one that goes beyond just being digital gold?

2025-08-03 03:12:01,"EigenCloud's thesis: ETH is programmable gold, and should secure every service in the world. EigenCloud is now the fastest-growing developer ecosystem in crypto: 167% growth year-over-year, outpacing Aptos (96%), Solana (83%), Internet Computer (75%), and Base (50%). This isn’t hype. It signals Ethereum’s core premise maturing: a neutral trust layer anyone can tap into.

Ethereum is becoming hyper-modular. Its consensus — secured by ETH staking — is no longer confined to Ethereum itself. EigenCloud’s ""restaking"" allows validators to extend ETH’s security to other Actively Validated Services (AVSs). ETH becomes programmable gold: the universal security asset underpinning a decentralized internet.

Key economic insight:

ETH holders: passive maintainers, providing neutral, commodity-like security and earning staking yield.

EIGEN holders: active governance participants, handling subjective decisions (trusted data, AI outputs, off-chain disputes).

This division keeps Ethereum neutral while enabling innovation at its edges.

Builders flock to this model. Instead of recreating consensus, they plug into Ethereum’s trust engine. Metrics back this:

$16B+ ETH restaked via EigenCloud.

40+ live AVSs, 160+ in development.

$42B TVL across Ethereum-settled rollups.

This modular approach replaces Web2’s walled gardens with open coordination. Integration doesn’t require absorption: services can specialize yet interoperate via Ethereum’s neutral base.

Risks remain: shared security creates interdependence, and governance of subjective systems is untested. But the direction is clear. Ethereum isn’t just scaling: it’s becoming the world’s trust anchor.

EigenCloud’s growth isn’t just another trend. It’s proof ETH is programmable gold, destined to secure every meaningful digital service.

Just dropping in with some thoughts on Polkadot (DOT). The market keeps obsessing over the same old names, sleeping on the real game changer right here. DOT isn't your typical crypto hype—it's laying down infrastructure for the multi-chain future everyone keeps talking about but few really understand.

Polkadot's parachains are quietly connecting the dots (pun intended), offering real interoperability between blockchains, something we're desperately going to need. The dev community around DOT is strong, smart, and growing fast, and Gavin Wood isn't here to play—he built Ethereum, and he's building something bigger now.

Market sentiment is bearish, people are bored, prices have dipped. But that's exactly why I love it. Fundamentals are solid, development is relentless, and the upside potential once the market wakes up is huge.

I'm not advising anyone here; I'm just telling you my conviction and where I'm putting my bets. Call me crazy, but I like DOT.
